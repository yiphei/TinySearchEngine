* index.h - header file for CS50 'index' module
* 
* The index module that contains all the logic for building, saving and loading index files 
* (this module is common between the Crawler and Indexer). Given a directory created by crawler, 
* it first builds an index of all the words and the frequency of the words in each document in the 
* given directory. After building an index, it outputs the index in a formatted way to a given file. 
* Then, load_index reads the output of index_save and rebuilds an index from it.
