# CS50 Tiny Search Engine (TSE) utility library

David Kotz, April 2016, 2017.

These modules support the TSE project.  Feel free to drop in your implementation of the data-structure modules, but **do not change any of the other source files in this directory.**

## Usage
To build `libcs50.a`, run `make`. 
The starter kit includes two pre-built libraries:

 * `libcs50.a-Darwin` is for MacOS (may not work on all MacOS versions)
 * `libcs50.a-Linux` is for Linux, built on standard CS50 servers 

If you prefer our data-structure implementation over your own, copy it into place:

 * `cp libcs50.a-Darwin libcs50.a`, or
 * `cp libcs50.a-Linux libcs50.a`

Indeed, in that case, you may want to modify the Makefile to replace the rule for `$(LIB)`:

```
$(LIB):
	cp $(LIB)-`uname` $(LIB)
```

To clean up, run `make clean`.
