<p><b>Abstract:</b> A logic-based language is often adopted in systems for pervasive
computing, because it provides a convenient way to define rules that change
the behavior of the systems dynamically. Those systems might define rules
that refer to the users' context information to provide context-aware
services. For example, a smart-home application could define rules referring
to the location of a user to control the light of a house automatically. In
general, the context information is maintained in different administrative
domains, and it is, therefore, desirable to construct a proof in a
distributed way while preserving each domain's confidentiality policies. In
this paper, we introduce such a system, a secure distributed proof system for
context-sensitive authorization and show that our novel caching and
revocation mechanism improves the performance of the system, which depends on
public key cryptographic operations to protect confidential information in
rules and facts. Our revocation mechanism maintains dependencies among facts
and recursively revokes across multiple hosts all the cached facts that
depend on a fact that has become invalid. Our initial experimental results
show that our caching mechanism, which maintains both positive and negative
facts, significantly reduces the latency for handling a logical query.</p>
