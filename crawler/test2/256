<p><b>Abstract:</b> In this paper we present a context-sensing component that
recognizes meetings in a typical office environment. Our prototype detects
the meeting start and end by combining outputs from pressure and motion
sensors installed on the chairs. We developed a telephone controller
application that transfers incoming calls to voice-mail when the user is in a
meeting. Our experiments show that it is feasible to detect high-level
context changes with ``good enough'' accuracy, using low-cost, off-the-shelf
hardware, and simple algorithms without complex training. We also note the
need for better metrics to measure context detection performance, other than
just accuracy. We propose several metrics appropriate for our application in
this paper. It may be useful, however, for the community to define a set of
general metrics as a basis to compare different approaches of context
detection.</p>
