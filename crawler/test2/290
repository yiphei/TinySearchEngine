<p><b>Abstract:</b> Wearable, portable, and implantable medical sensors have ushered
in a new paradigm for healthcare in which patients can take greater
responsibility and caregivers can make well-informed, timely decisions.
Health-monitoring systems built on such sensors have huge potential benefit
to the quality of healthcare and quality of life for many people, such as
patients with chronic medical conditions (such as blood-sugar sensors for
diabetics), people seeking to change unhealthy behavior (such as losing
weight or quitting smoking), or athletes wishing to monitor their condition
and performance. To be effective, however, these systems must provide
assurances about the quality of the sensor data. The sensors must be applied
to the patient by a human, and the sensor data may be transported across
multiple networks and devices before it is presented to the medical team.
While no system can guarantee data quality, we anticipate that it will help
for the system to annotate data with some measure of confidence. In
this paper, we take a deeper look at potential health-monitoring usage
scenarios and highlight research challenges required to ensure and assess
quality of sensor data in health-monitoring systems.</p>
