<p><b>Abstract:</b> Many pervasive-computing applications depend on knowledge of user
location. Because most current location-sensing techniques work only either
indoors or outdoors, researchers have started using 802.11 beacon frames from
access points (APs) to provide broader coverage. To use 802.11 beacons, they
need to know AP locations. Because the actual locations are often
unavailable, they use estimated locations from  war driving. But these
estimated locations may be different from actual locations. In this paper, we
analyzed the errors in these estimates and the effect of these errors on
other applications that depend on them. We found that the estimated AP
locations have a median error of 32&nbsp;meters. We considered the error in
tracking user positions both indoors and outdoors. Using actual AP locations,
we could improve the accuracy as much as 70 0.000000or indoors and 59 0.000000or
outdoors. We also analyzed the effect of using estimated AP locations in
computing AP coverage range and estimating interference among APs. The
coverage range appeared to be shorter and the interference appeared to be
more severe than in reality.</p>
