<b>Solar: A pervasive-computing infrastructure for context-aware
mobile applications</b>.

<p><b>Abstract:</b> Emerging pervasive computing technologies transform the way we
live and work by embedding computation in our surrounding environment. To
avoid increasing complexity, and allow the user to concentrate on her tasks,
applications must automatically adapt to their changing  context, the
physical and computational environment in which they run. To support these
``context-aware'' applications we propose a graph-based abstraction for
collecting, aggregating, and disseminating context information. The
abstraction models context information as  events, which are produced by
 sources, flow through a directed acyclic graph of event-processing 
operators, and are delivered to subscribing applications. Applications
describe their desired event stream as a tree of operators that aggregate
low-level context information published by existing sources into the
high-level context information needed by the application. The  operator
graph is thus the dynamic combination of all applications' subscription
trees. In this paper, we motivate our graph abstraction by discussing several
applications under development, sketch the architecture of our system
(``Solar'') that implements our abstraction, report some early experimental
results from the prototype, and outline issues for future research.</p>
