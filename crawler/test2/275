<b>Secure Context-sensitive Authorization</b>.

<p><b>Abstract:</b> Pervasive computing leads to an increased integration between the
real world and the computational world, and many applications in pervasive
computing adapt to the user's context, such as the location of the user and
relevant devices, the presence of other people, light or sound conditions, or
available network bandwidth, to meet a user's continuously changing
requirements without taking explicit input from the users. <P> We consider a
class of applications that wish to consider a user's context when deciding
whether to authorize a user's access to important physical or information
resources. Such a context-sensitive authorization scheme is necessary when a
mobile user moves across multiple administrative domains where they are not
registered in advance. Also, users interacting with their environment need a
non-intrusive way to access resources, and clues about their context may be
useful input into authorization policies for these resources. Existing
systems for context-sensitive authorization take a logic-based approach,
because a logical language makes it possible to define a context model where
a contextual fact is expressed with a boolean predicate and to derive
higher-level context information and authorization decisions from contextual
facts. <P> However, those existing context-sensitive authorization systems
have a central server that collects context information, and evaluates
policies to make authorization decisions on behalf of a resource owner. A
centralized solution assumes that all resource owners trust the server to
make correct decisions, and all users trust the server not to disclose
private context information. In many realistic applications of pervasive
computing, however, the resources, users, and sources of context information
are inherently distributed among many organizations that do not necessarily
trust each other. Resource owners may not trust the integrity of context
information produced by another domain, and context sensors may not trust
others with the confidentiality of data they provide about users. <P> In
this thesis, we present a secure distributed proof system for
context-sensitive authorization. Our system enables multiple hosts to
evaluate an authorization query in a peer-to-peer way, while preserving the
confidentiality and integrity policies of mutually untrusted principals
running those hosts. We also develop a novel caching and revocation mechanism
to support context-sensitive policies that refer to information in dozens of
different administrative domains. Contributions of this thesis include the
definition of fine-grained security policies that specify trust relations
among principals in terms of information confidentiality and integrity, the
design and implementation of a secure distributed proof system, a proof for
the correctness of our algorithm, and a performance evaluation showing that
the amortized performance of our system scales to dozens of servers in
different domains.</p>
