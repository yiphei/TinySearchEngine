<p><b>Abstract:</b> The edge of the Internet is increasingly becoming wireless.
Therefore, monitoring the wireless edge is important to understanding the
security and performance aspects of the Internet experience. We have designed
and implemented a large-scale WLAN monitoring system, the Distributed
Internet Security Testbed (DIST), at Dartmouth College. It is equipped with
distributed arrays of ``sniffers'' that cover 210 diverse campus locations
and more than 5,000 users. In this paper, we describe our approach, designs
and solutions for addressing the technical challenges that have resulted from
efficiency, scalability, security, and management perspectives. We also
present extensive evaluation results on a production network, and summarize
the lessons learned.</p>
