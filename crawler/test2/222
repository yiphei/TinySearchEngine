<p><b>Abstract:</b> Location is an important feature for many applications, and
wireless networks can better serve their clients by anticipating client
mobility. As a result, many location predictors have been proposed in the
literature, though few have been evaluated with empirical evidence. This
paper reports on the results of the first extensive empirical evaluation of
location predictors, using a two-year trace of the mobility patterns of over
6,000 users on Dartmouth's campus-wide Wi-Fi wireless network. <P> We
implemented and compared the prediction accuracy of several location
predictors drawn from two major families of domain-independent predictors,
namely Markov-based and compression-based predictors. We found that low-order
Markov predictors performed as well or better than the more complex and more
space-consuming compression-based predictors. Predictors of both families
fail to make a prediction when the recent context has not been previously
seen. To overcome this drawback, we added a simple fallback feature to each
predictor and found that it significantly enhanced its accuracy in exchange
for modest effort. Thus the Order-2 Markov predictor with fallback was the
best predictor we studied, obtaining a median accuracy of about 72 0.000000or
users with long trace lengths. We also investigated a simplification of the
Markov predictors, where the prediction is based not on the most frequently
seen context in the past, but the most recent, resulting in significant space
and computational savings. We found that Markov predictors with this recency
semantics can rival the accuracy of standard Markov predictors in some cases.
Finally, we considered several seemingly obvious enhancements, such as
smarter tie-breaking and aging of context information, and discovered that
they had little effect on accuracy. The paper ends with a discussion and
suggestions for further work.</p>
