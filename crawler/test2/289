<p><b>Abstract:</b> Mobile medical sensors promise to provide an efficient, accurate,
and economic way to monitor patients' health outside the hospital. Patient
authentication is a necessary security requirement in remote health
monitoring scenarios. The monitoring system needs to make sure that the data
is coming from the right person before any medical or financial decisions are
made based on the data. Credential-based authentication methods (e.g.,
passwords, certificates) are not well-suited for remote healthcare as
patients could hand over credentials to someone else. Furthermore, one-time
authentication using credentials or trait-based biometrics (e.g., face,
fingerprints, iris) do not cover the entire monitoring period and may lead to
unauthorized post-authentication use. Recent studies have shown that the
human electrocardiogram (ECG) exhibits unique patterns that can be used to
discriminate individuals. However, perturbation of the ECG signal due to
physical activity is a major obstacle in applying the technology in
real-world situations. In this paper, we present a novel ECG and
accelerometer-based system that can authenticate individuals in an ongoing
manner under various activity conditions. We describe the probabilistic
authentication system we have developed and present experimental results from
17 individuals.</p>
