<p><b>Abstract:</b> Researchers choosing to share wireless-network traces with
colleagues must first anonymize sensitive information, trading off the
removal of information in the interest of identity protection and the
preservation of useful data within the trace. While several metrics exist to
quantify this privacy-utility tradeoff, they are often computationally
expensive. Computing these metrics using a sample of the trace could
potentially save precious time. In this paper, we examine several sampling
methods to discover their effects on measurement of the privacy-utility
tradeoff when anonymizing network traces. We tested the relative accuracy of
several packet and flow-sampling methods on existing privacy and utility
metrics. We concluded that, for our test trace, no single sampling method we
examined allowed us to accurately measure the tradeoff, and that some
sampling methods can produce grossly inaccurate estimates of those values. We
call for further research to develop sampling methods that maintain relevant
privacy and utility properties.</p>
