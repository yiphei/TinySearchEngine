<b>A Combined Routing Method for Ad hoc Wireless Networks</b>.
Technical Report
TR2007-588,
Dartmouth Computer Science,
June 
2007.
<p><b>Abstract:</b> To make ad hoc wireless networks adaptive to different mobility
and traffic patterns, this paper proposes an approach to swap from one
protocol to another protocol dynamically, while routing continues. By the
insertion of a thin new layer, we were able to make each node in the ad hoc
wireless network notify each other about the protocol swap. To ensure that
routing works efficiently after the protocol swap, we initialized the
destination routing protocol's data structures and reused the previous
routing information to build the new routing table. We also tested our
approach under different network topologies and traffic patterns in static
networks to learn whether the swap was fast and whether the swap incurred too
much overhead. We found that the swap latency was related to the nature of
the destination protocol and the topology of the network. We also found that
the control packet ratio after swap was close to that of the protocol running
without swap, which indicates that our method does not incur too much
overhead for the swap.</p>
