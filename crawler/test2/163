<b>A Combined Routing Method for Ad hoc Wireless Networks</b>.
Masters Thesis,
Dartmouth College Computer Science,
December 
2005.
Available as Dartmouth Computer Science Technical Report TR2005-566.
<p><b>Abstract:</b> To make ad hoc wireless networks adaptive to different mobility
and traffic patterns, we studied in this thesis an approach to swap from one
protocol to another protocol dynamically, while routing continues. By the
insertion of a new layer, we were able to make each node in the ad hoc
wireless network notify each other about the protocol swap. To ensure that
routing works efficiently after the protocol swap, we initialized the
destination routing protocol's data structures and reused the previous
routing information to build the new routing table. We also tested our
approach under different network topologies and traffic patterns in static
networks to learn whether the swap is fast and whether the swap incurs too
much overload . We found that the swap latency is related to the destination
protocol and the topology of the network. We also found that the control
packet ratio after swap is close to the protocol running without swap, which
means our method does not incur too many control packets for swap.</p>
