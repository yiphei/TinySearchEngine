<p><b>Abstract:</b> Opportunistic sensing allows applications to ``task'' mobile
devices to measure context in a target region. For example, one could
leverage sensor-equipped vehicles to measure traffic or pollution levels on a
particular street or users' mobile phones to locate (Bluetooth-enabled)
objects in their vicinity. In most proposed applications, context reports
include the time and location of the event, putting the privacy of users at
increased risk: even if identifying information has been removed from a
report, the accompanying time and location can reveal sufficient information
to de-anonymize the user whose device sent the report. We propose and
evaluate a novel spatiotemporal blurring mechanism based on tessellation and
clustering to protect users' privacy against the system while reporting
context. Our technique employs a notion of probabilistic k-anonymity; it
allows users to perform local blurring of reports efficiently without an
online anonymization server before the data are sent to the system. The
proposed scheme can control the degree of certainty in location privacy and
the quality of reports through a system parameter. We outline the
architecture and security properties of our approach and evaluate our
tessellation and clustering algorithm against real mobility traces.</p>
