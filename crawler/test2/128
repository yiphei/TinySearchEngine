<p><b>Abstract:</b> Worldwide applications exist in an environment that is inherently
distributed, dynamic, heterogeneous, insecure, unreliable, and unpredictable.
In particular, the latency and bandwidth of network connections varies
tremendously from place to place and time to time, particularly when
considering wireless networks, mobile devices, and satellite connections.
Applications in this environment must be able to adapt to different and
changing conditions. We believe that transportable autonomous agents provide
an excellent mechanism for the construction of such applications. We describe
our prototype transportable-agent system and several applications.</p>
