<b>Secure Context-sensitive Authorization</b>.
Technical Report
TR2004-529,
Dartmouth Computer Science,
December 
2004.
<p><b>Abstract:</b> There is a recent trend toward rule-based authorization systems
to achieve flexible security policies. Also, new sensing technologies in
pervasive computing make it possible to define context-sensitive rules, such
as ``allow database access only to staff who are currently located in the
main office.'' However, these rules, or the facts that are needed to verify
authority, often involve sensitive context information. This paper presents a
secure context-sensitive authorization system that protects confidential
information in facts or rules. Furthermore, our system allows multiple hosts
in a distributed environment to perform the evaluation of an authorization
query in a collaborative way; we do not need a universally trusted central
host that maintains all the context information. The core of our approach is
to decompose a proof for making an authorization decision into a set of
sub-proofs produced on multiple different hosts, while preserving the
integrity and confidentiality policies of the mutually untrusted principals
operating these hosts. We prove the correctness of our algorithm.</p>
