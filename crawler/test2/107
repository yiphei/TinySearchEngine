<p><b>Abstract:</b> High-performance computing increasingly occurs on ``computational
grids'' composed of heterogeneous and geographically distributed systems of
computers, networks, and storage devices that collectively act as a single
``virtual'' computer. One of the great challenges for this environment is to
provide efficient access to data that is distributed across remote data
servers in a grid. In this paper, we describe our solution, a framework we
call Armada. Armada allows applications to flexibly compose modules to access
their data, and to place those modules at appropriate hosts within the grid
to reduce network traffic.</p>
