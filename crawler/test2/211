<b>Dartmouth Internet Security Testbed (DIST): building a campus-wide
wireless testbed</b>.

<p><b>Abstract:</b> We describe our experiences in deploying a campus-wide wireless
security testbed. The testbed gives us the capability to monitor
security-related aspects of the 802.11 MAC layer in over 200 diverse campus
locations. We describe both the technical and the social challenges of
designing, building, and deploying such a system, which, to the best of our
knowledge, is the largest such testbed in academia (with the UCSD's Jigsaw
infrastructure a close competitor). In this paper we focus on the 
testbed setup, rather than on the experimental data and results.</p>
