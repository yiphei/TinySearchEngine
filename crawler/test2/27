<p><b>Abstract:</b> The Institute for Security Technology Studies (ISTS) was founded
at Dartmouth College in 2000 as a national center of security research and
development. The Institute conducts interdisciplinary research and
development projects addressing the challenges of cyber and homeland
security, to protect the integrity of the Internet, computer networks, and
other interdependent information infrastructures. ISTS also develops
technology for providing the information and tools necessary to assist
communities and first responders with the evolving, complex security
landscape. ISTS is a member of and administers the Institute for Information
Infrastructure Protection (I3P), a consortium of 24 leading academic
institutions, non-profits and federal laboratories that brings industry,
academia and government together to articulate and focus on problems that
need to be solved to help ensure the nation's information infrastructure is
safe, secure, and robust.</p>
