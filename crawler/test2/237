<p><b>Abstract:</b> I tackle the problem of naming and sharing resources across
administrative boundaries. Conventional systems manifest the hierarchy of
typical administrative structure in the structure of their own mechanism.
While natural for communication that follows hierarchical patterns, such
systems interfere with naming and sharing that cross administrative
boundaries, and therefore cause headaches for both users and administrators.
I propose to organize resource naming and security, not around administrative
domains, but around the sharing patterns of users. <P> The dissertation is
organized into four main parts. First, I discuss the challenges and tradeoffs
involved in naming resources and consider a variety of existing approaches to
naming. <P> Second, I consider the architectural requirements for
user-centric sharing. I evaluate existing systems with respect to these
requirements. <P> Third, to support the sharing architecture, I develop a
formal logic of sharing that captures the notion of restricted delegation.
Restricted delegation ensures that users can use the same mechanisms to share
resources consistently, regardless of the origin of the resource, or with
whom the user wishes to share the resource next. A formal semantics gives
unambiguous meaning to the logic. I apply the formalism to the Simple Public
Key Infrastructure and discuss how the formalism either supports or
discourages potential extensions to such a system. <P> Finally, I use the
formalism to drive a user-centric sharing implementation for distributed
systems. I show how this implementation enables end-to-end authorization, a
feature that makes heterogeneous distributed systems more secure and easier
to audit. Conventionally, gateway services that bridge administrative
domains, add abstraction, or translate protocols typically impede the flow of
authorization information from client to server. In contrast, end-to-end
authorization enables us to build gateway services that preserve
authorization information, hence we reduce the size of the trusted computing
base and enable more effective auditing. I demonstrate my implementation and
show how it enables end-to-end authorization across various boundaries. I
measure my implementation and argue that its performance tracks that of
similar authorization mechanisms without end-to-end structure. <P> I
conclude that my user-centric philosophy of naming and sharing benefits both
users and administrators.</p>
