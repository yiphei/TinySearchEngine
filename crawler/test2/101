<p><b>Abstract:</b> As we gain experience with parallel file systems, it becomes
increasingly clear that a single solution does not suit all applications. For
example, it appears to be impossible to find a single appropriate interface,
caching policy, file structure, or disk-management strategy. Furthermore, the
proliferation of file-system interfaces and abstractions make applications
difficult to port. <P> We propose that the traditional functionality of
parallel file systems be separated into two components: a fixed core that is
standard on all platforms, encapsulating only primitive abstractions and
interfaces, and a set of high-level libraries to provide a variety of
abstractions and application-programmer interfaces (APIs). <P> We present
our current and next-generation file systems as examples of this structure.
Their features, such as a three-dimensional file structure, strided read and
write interfaces, and I/O-node programs, re specifically designed with the
flexibility and performance necessary to support a wide range of
applications.</p>
