<p><b>Abstract:</b> Wireless network researchers are seriously starved for data about
how real users, applications, and devices use real networks under real
network conditions. CRAWDAD, a Community Resource for Archiving Wireless Data
at Dartmouth, is a new NSF-funded project to build a wireless network data
archive for the research community. We host wireless data, and provide tools
and documents to make it easy to collect and use wireless network data. We
hope that this resource will help researchers identify and evaluate real and
interesting problems in mobile and pervasive computing. This report outlines
the CRAWDAD project, the kick-off workshop that was held at MobiCom 2005, and
the latest news.</p>
