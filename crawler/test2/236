<b>An Access-Control Calculus for Spanning Administrative Domains</b>.
Technical Report
PCS-TR99-361,
Dartmouth Computer Science,
November 
1999.
<p><b>Abstract:</b> In our quest to give users uniform access to resources unimpeded
by administrative boundaries, we discovered that we needed transitive sharing
among users, with the possibility of restricted access along each sharing
link. To achieve that goal, we extend Lampson et al.'s calculus for access
control to support restricted delegations. We discuss the advantages of our
extension, including the simplification of constructs like ACLs and statement
expiration. We also apply our extension to model the Simple Public Key
Infrastructure and make suggestions about its future development. Our
extended calculus exposes some surprising consequences in such systems that
use restricted delegation.</p>
