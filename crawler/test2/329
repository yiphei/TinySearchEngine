<b>Vocal resonance as a biometric for pervasive wearable devices</b>.

<p><b>Abstract:</b> We anticipate the advent of body-area networks of pervasive
wearable devices, whether for health monitoring, personal assistance,
entertainment, or home automation. In our vision, the user can simply wear
the desired set of devices, and they "just work"; no configuration is needed,
and yet they discover each other, recognize that they are on the same body,
configure a secure communications channel, and identify the user to which
they are attached. This paper addresses a method to achieve the latter, that
is, for a wearable device to identify the wearer, allowing sensor data to be
properly labeled or personalized behavior to be properly achieved. We use
vocal resonance, that is, the sound of the person's voice as it travels
through the person's body. By collecting voice samples from a small wearable
microphone, our method allows the device to determine whether (a) the speaker
is indeed the expected person, and (b) the microphone device is physically on
the speaker's body. We collected data from 25 subjects, demonstrate the
feasibility of a prototype, and show that our method works with 77 0x0.07fd95a58d8bp-1022ccuracy
when a threshold is chosen a priori.</p>
