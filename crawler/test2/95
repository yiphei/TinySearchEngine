<b>Exploring the use of I/O Nodes for Computation in a MIMD
Multiprocessor</b>.

and Distributed Systems (IOPADS)</i>,

<p><b>Abstract:</b> As parallel systems move into the production scientific-computing
world, the emphasis will be on cost-effective solutions that provide high
throughput for a mix of applications. Cost-effective solutions demand that a
system make effective use of all of its resources. Many MIMD multiprocessors
today, however, distinguish between ``compute'' and ``I/O'' nodes, the latter
having attached disks and being dedicated to running the file-system server.
This static division of responsibilities simplifies system management but
does not necessarily lead to the best performance in workloads that need a
different balance of computation and I/O. <P> Of course, computational
processes sharing a node with a file-system service may receive less CPU
time, network bandwidth, and memory bandwidth than they would on a
computation-only node. In this paper we begin to examine this issue
experimentally. We found that high-performance I/O does not necessarily
require substantial CPU time, leaving plenty of time for application
computation. There were some complex file-system requests, however, which
left little CPU time available to the application. (The impact on network and
memory bandwidth still needs to be determined.) For applications (or users)
that cannot tolerate an occasional interruption, we recommend that they
continue to use only compute nodes. For tolerant applications needing more
cycles than those provided by the compute nodes, we recommend that they take
full advantage of  both compute and I/O nodes for computation, and
that operating systems should make this possible.</p>
