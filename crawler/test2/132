<p><b>Abstract:</b> Transportable agents are autonomous programs. They can move
through a heterogeneous network of computers under their own control,
migrating from host to host. They can sense the state of the network, monitor
software conditions, and interact with other agents or resources. The
network-sensing tools allow our agents to adapt to the network configuration
and to navigate under the control of reactive plans. In this paper we
describe the design and implementation of the navigation system that gives
our agents autonomy. We also discuss the intelligent and adaptive behavior of
autonomous agents in distributed information-gathering tasks.</p>
