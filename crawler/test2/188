<b>Characterizing Usage of a Campus-wide Wireless Network</b>.

<p><b>Abstract:</b> Wireless local-area networks (WLANs) are increasingly common, but
little is known about how they are used. A clear understanding of usage
patterns in real WLANs is critical information to those who develop, deploy,
and manage WLAN technology, as well as those who develop systems and
application software for wireless networks. This paper presents results from
the largest and most comprehensive trace of network activity in a large,
production wireless LAN. For eleven weeks we traced the activity of nearly
two thousand users drawn from a general campus population, using a
campus-wide network of 476 access points spread over 161 buildings. Our study
expands on those done by Tang and Baker, with a significantly larger and
broader population. <P> We found that residential traffic dominated all
other traffic, particularly in residences populated by newer students;
students are increasingly choosing a wireless laptop as their primary
computer. Although web protocols were the single largest component of traffic
volume, network backup and file sharing contributed an unexpectedly large
amount to the traffic. Although there was some roaming within a network
session, we were surprised by the number of situations in which cards roamed
excessively, unable to settle on one access point. Cross-subnet roams were an
especial problem, because they broke IP connections, indicating the need for
solutions that avoid or accommodate such roams.</p>
