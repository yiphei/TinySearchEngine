<b>Mobile agents for mobile computing</b>.

<p><b>Abstract:</b>  Mobile agents are programs that can move through a
network under their own control, migrating from host to host and interacting
with other agents and resources on each. We argue that these mobile,
autonomous agents have the potential to provide a convenient, efficient and
robust programming paradigm for distributed applications, particularly when
partially connected computers are involved. Partially connected computers
include mobile computers such as laptops and personal digital assistants as
well as modem-connected home computers, all of which are often disconnected
from the network. In this paper, we describe the design and implementation of
our mobile-agent system, Agent Tcl, and the specific features that support
mobile computers and disconnected operation. These features include
network-sensing tools and a  docking system that allows an agent to
transparently move between mobile computers, regardless of when the computers
connect to the network.</p>
