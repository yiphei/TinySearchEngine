<p><b>Abstract:</b> Use of the Internet has exploded in recent years with the
appearance of the World-Wide Web. In this paper, we show how current
technological trends necessarily lead to a system based substantially on
mobile code, and in many cases, mobile agents. We discuss several technical
and non-technical hurdles along the path to that eventuality. Finally, we
predict that, within five years, nearly all major Internet sites will be
capable of hosting and willing to host some form of mobile agents.</p>
