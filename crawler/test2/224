<p><b>Abstract:</b> Wireless local area networks (WLANs) are emerging as a popular
technology for access to the Internet and enterprise networks. In the long
term, the success of WLANs depends on services that support mobile network
clients. <P> Although other researchers have explored mobility prediction in
hypothetical scenarios, evaluating their predictors analytically or with
synthetic data, few studies have been able to evaluate their predictors with
real user mobility data. As a first step towards filling this fundamental
gap, we work with a large data set collected from the Dartmouth College
campus-wide wireless network that hosts more than 500 access points and 6,000
users. Extending our earlier work that focuses on predicting the next-visited
access point (i.e., location), in this work we explore the predictability of
the time of user mobility. Indeed, our contributions are two-fold. First, we
evaluate a series of predictors that reflect possible dependencies across
time and space while benefiting from either individual or group mobility
behaviors. Second, as a case study we examine voice applications and the use
of handoff prediction for advance bandwidth reservation. Using
application-specific performance metrics such as call drop and call block
rates, we provide a picture of the potential gains of prediction. <P> Our
results indicate that it is difficult to predict handoff time accurately,
when applied to real campus WLAN data. However, the findings of our case
study also suggest that application performance can be improved significantly
even with predictors that are only moderately accurate. The gains depend on
the applications' ability to use predictions and tolerate inaccurate
predictions. In the case study, we combine the real mobility data with
synthesized traffic data. The results show that intelligent prediction can
lead to significant reductions in the rate at which active calls are dropped
due to handoffs with marginal increments in the rate at which new calls are
blocked.</p>
