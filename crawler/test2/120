<p><b>Abstract:</b> This paper considers resource allocation in a network with mobile
agents competing for computational priority. We formulate this problem as a
multi-agent game with the players being agents purchasing service from a
common server. We show that there exists a computable Nash equilibrium when
agents have perfect information into the future. From our game, we build a
market-based CPU allocation policy and a strategy with which an agent may
plan its expenditures for a multi-hop itinerary. We simulate a network of
hosts and agents using our strategy to show that our resource-allocation
mechanism effectively prioritizes agents according to their endowments and
that our planning algorithm handles network delay gracefully.</p>
