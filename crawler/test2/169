<p><b>Abstract:</b> Centrality is a concept often used in social network analysis to
study different properties of networks that are modeled as graphs. We present
a new centrality metric called Localized Bridging Centrality (LBC). LBC is
based on the Bridging Centrality (BC) metric that Hwang et al. recently
introduced. Bridging nodes are nodes that are strategically located in
between highly connected regions. LBC is capable of identifying bridging
nodes with an accuracy comparable to that of the BC metric for most networks.
As the name suggests, we use only local information from surrounding nodes to
compute the LBC metric, whereas, global knowledge is required to calculate
the BC metric. The main difference between LBC and BC is that LBC uses the
egocentric definition of betweenness centrality to identify bridging nodes,
while BC uses the sociocentric definition of betweenness centrality. Thus,
our LBC metric is suitable for distributed or parallel computation and has
the benefit of being an order of magnitude faster to calculate in
computational complexity. We compare the results produced by BC and LBC in
three examples. We applied our LBC metric for network analysis of a real
wireless mesh network. Our results indicate that the LBC metric is as
powerful as the BC metric at identifying bridging nodes. The LBC metric is
thus an important tool that can help network administrators identify critical
nodes that are important for the robustness of the network in a distributed
manner.</p>
