<p><b>Abstract:</b> Understanding user mobility and its effect on access points (APs)
is important in designing location-aware systems and wireless networks.
Although various studies of wireless networks have provided useful insights,
it is hard to apply them to other situations. Here we present a general
methodology for extracting mobility information from wireless network traces,
and for classifying mobile users and APs. We used the Fourier transform to
reveal important periods and chose the two strongest periods to serve as
parameters to a classification system based on Bayes' theory. Analysis of
1-month traces shows that while a daily pattern is common among both users
and APs, a weekly pattern is common only for APs. Analysis of 1-year traces
revealed that both user mobility and AP popularity depend on the academic
calendar. By plotting the classes of APs on our campus map, we discovered
that their periodic behavior depends on their proximity to other APs.</p>
