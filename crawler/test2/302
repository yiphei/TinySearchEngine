<p><b>Abstract:</b> As personal health sensors become ubiquitous, we also expect them
to become interoperable. That is, instead of closed, end-to-end personal
health sensing systems, we envision standardized sensors wirelessly
communicating their data to a device many people already carry today, the
cellphone. In an open personal health sensing system, users will be able to
seamlessly pair off-the-shelf sensors with their cellphone and expect the
system to \it just work. However, this ubiquity of sensors creates the
potential for users to accidentally wear sensors that are not necessarily
paired with their own cellphone. A husband, for example, might mistakenly
wear a heart-rate sensor that is actually paired with his wife's cellphone.
As long as the heart-rate sensor is within communication range, the wife's
cellphone will be receiving heart-rate data about her husband, data that is
incorrectly entered into her own health record. <P> We provide a method to
probabilistically detect this situation. Because accelerometers are
relatively cheap and require little power, we imagine that the cellphone and
each sensor will have a companion accelerometer embedded with the sensor
itself. We extract standard features from these companion accelerometers, and
use a pair-wise statistic&nbsp;- coherence, a measurement of how well two signals
are related in the frequency domain&nbsp;- to determine how well features
correlate for different locations on the body. We then use these feature
coherences to train a classifier to recognize whether a pair of sensors&nbsp;- or
a sensor and a cellphone&nbsp;- are on the same body. We evaluate our method over
a dataset of several individuals walking around with sensors in various
positions on their body and experimentally show that our method is capable of
achieving an accuracies over 80%.0</p>
