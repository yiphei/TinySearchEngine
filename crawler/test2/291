<p><b>Abstract:</b> In this paper, we consider the challenge of preserving patient
privacy in the context of mobile healthcare and home-care systems, that is,
the use of mobile computing and communications technologies in the delivery
of healthcare or the provision of at-home medical care and assisted living.
This paper makes three primary contributions. First, we compare existing
privacy frameworks, identifying key differences and shortcomings. Second, we
identify a privacy framework for mobile healthcare and home-care systems.
Third, we extract a set of privacy properties intended for use by those who
design systems and applications for mobile healthcare and home-care systems,
linking them back to the privacy principles. Finally, we list several
important research questions that the community should address. We hope that
the privacy framework in this paper can help to guide the researchers and
developers in this community, and that the privacy properties provide a
concrete foundation for privacy-sensitive systems and applications for mobile
healthcare and home-care systems.</p>
