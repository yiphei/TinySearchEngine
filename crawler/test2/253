<p><b>Abstract:</b> Many ``ubiquitous computing'' applications need a constant flow
of information about their environment to be able to adapt to their changing
context. To support these ``context-aware'' applications we propose a
graph-based abstraction for collecting, aggregating, and disseminating
context information. The abstraction models context information as events,
produced by sources and flowing through a directed acyclic graph of
event-processing operators and delivered to subscribing applications.
Applications describe their desired event stream as a tree of operators that
aggregate low-level context information published by existing sources into
the high-level context information needed by the application. The operator
graph is thus the dynamic combination of all applications' subscription
trees. <P> In this paper, we motivate and describe our graph abstraction,
and discuss a variety of critical design issues. We also sketch our Solar
system, an implementation that represents one point in the design space for
our graph abstraction.</p>
