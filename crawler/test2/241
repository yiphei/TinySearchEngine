<p><b>Abstract:</b> Many boundaries impede the flow of authorization information,
forcing applications that span those boundaries into hop-by-hop approaches to
authorization. We present a unified approach to authorization. Our approach
allows applications that span administrative, network, abstraction, and
protocol boundaries to understand the end-to-end authority that justifies any
given request. The resulting distributed systems are more secure and easier
to audit. <P> We describe boundaries that can interfere with end-to-end
authorization, and outline our unified approach. We describe the system we
built and the applications we adapted to use our unified authorization
system, and measure its costs. We conclude that our system is a practical
approach to the desirable goal of end-to-end authorization.</p>
