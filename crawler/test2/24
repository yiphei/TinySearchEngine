<p><b>Abstract:</b> Communication is a very important factor affecting distributed
applications. Getting a close handle on network performance (both bandwidth
and latency) is thus crucial to understanding overall application
performance. We benchmarked some of the metrics of network performance using
two sets of experiments, namely roundtrip and datahose. The tests were
designed to measure a combination of network latency, bandwidth, and
contention. We repeated the tests for two protocols (TCP/IP and MPI) and
three networks (100 Mbit FDDI (Fiber Distributed Data Interface), 100 Mbit
Fast Ethernet, and 10 Mbit Ethernet). The performance results provided
interesting insights into the behaviour of these networks under different
load conditions and the software overheads associated with an MPI
implementation (MPICH). This document presents details about the experiments,
their results, and our analysis of the performance. <P> Revised on 1/8/96 to
emphasize our use of a particular MPI implementation, MPICH.</p>
