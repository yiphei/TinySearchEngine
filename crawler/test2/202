<p><b>Abstract:</b> Monitoring the activity on an IEEE 802.11 network is useful for
many applications, such as network management, optimizing deployment, or
detecting network attacks. Deploying wireless sniffers to monitor every
access point in an enterprise network, however, may be expensive or
impractical. Moreover, some applications may require the deployment of
multiple sniffers to monitor the numerous channels in an 802.11 network. In
this paper, we explore sampling strategies for monitoring multiple channels
in 802.11b/g networks. We describe a simple sampling strategy, where each
channel is observed for an equal, predetermined length of time, and consider
applications where such a strategy might be appropriate. We then introduce a
sampling strategy that weights the time spent on each channel according to
the number of frames observed on that channel, and compare the two strategies
under experimental conditions.</p>
