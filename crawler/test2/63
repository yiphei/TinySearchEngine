<p><b>Abstract:</b> Parallel disk subsystems have been proposed as one way to close
the gap between processor and disk speeds. In a previous paper we showed that
prefetching and caching have the potential to deliver the performance
benefits of parallel file systems to parallel applications. In this paper we
describe experiments with practical prefetching policies, and show that
prefetching can be implemented efficiently even for the more complex parallel
file access patterns. We test these policies across a range of architectural
parameters.</p>
