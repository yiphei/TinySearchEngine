<b>Is Bluetooth the right technology for mHealth?</b>In

Position paper.
<p><b>Abstract:</b> Many people believe mobile healthcare (mHealth) would help
alleviate the rising cost of healthcare and improve the quality of service.
Bluetooth, which is the most popular wireless technology for personal medical
devices, is used for most of the mHealth sensing applications. In this paper
we raise the question - Is Bluetooth the right technology for mHealth? To
instigate the discussion we discuss some shortcomings of Bluetooth and also
point out an alternative solution.</p>
