<p><b>Abstract:</b> Anonymization is critical prior to sharing wireless-network
traces within the research community, to protect both personal and
organizational sensitive information from disclosure. One difficulty in
anonymization, or more generally, sanitization, is that users lack
information about the quality of a sanitization result, such as how much
privacy risk a sanitized trace may expose, and how much research utility the
sanitized trace may retain. We propose a framework, NetSANI, that allows
users to analyze and control the privacy/utility tradeoff in network
sanitization. NetSANI can accommodate most of the currently available privacy
and utility metrics for network trace sanitization. This framework provides a
set of APIs for analyzing the privacy/utility tradeoff by comparing the
changes in privacy and utility levels of a trace for a sanitization
operation. We demonstrate the framework with an quantitative evaluation on
wireless-network traces.</p>
