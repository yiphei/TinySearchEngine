<p><b>Abstract:</b> Popular smartphone authentication schemes, such as PIN-based or
biometrics-based authentication methods, require only an initial login at the
start of a usage session to authorize the user to use all the apps on the
phone during the entire session. Those schemes fail to provide continuous
protection of the smartphone after the initial login. They also fail to meet
the hierarchy of security requirements for different apps under different
contexts. In this study, we propose a continuous and hierarchical
authentication scheme. We believe that a user's app-usage patterns depend on
his location context. As such, our scheme relies on app-usage patterns in
different location context to continuously establish the log probability
density (LPD) of the authenticity of the current user. Based on different LPD
thresholds corresponding to different security requirements, the current user
either has a LPD higher than the threshold, which grants him continuous
access to the phone or the app, or he has a LPD lower than the threshold,
which locks him out of the phone or the app immediately. We test our scheme
on 4,600 subjects from the Device Analyzer Dataset. We found that our scheme
could correctly identify the authenticity of the majority of the subjects.
However, app-usage patterns with or without location context yielded similar
performances, indicating that user contexts did not contribute further
information to establish user behavioral patterns. Based on our scheme, we
propose a hypothetical Android app which would provide continuous and
hierarchical authentication for the smartphone users.</p>
