<b>SOLAR: Towards a Flexible and Scalable Data-Fusion Infrastructure
for Ubiquitous Computing</b>.

<p><b>Abstract:</b> As we embed more computers into our daily environment, ubiquitous
computing promises to make them less noticeable and to avoid information
overload. We see, however, few ubiquitous applications that are able to adapt
to the dynamics of user, physical, and computational context. The challenge
is to allow applications flexible access to these sources, and yet scale to
thousands of devices and sensors. In this paper we introduce our proposed
infrastructure, Solar. In Solar, information sources produce events.
Applications may subscribe to interesting sources directly, or they may
instantiate and subscribe to a tree of operators that filter, transform,
merge and aggregate events. Applications use a subscription language to
describe the tree, based on event streams registered in a context-sensitive
naming hierarchy. Solar is flexible: modular operators can be composed to
produce new event streams. Solar is scalable: it distributes operators across
hosts called Planets, and it re-uses common subgraphs in the operator
network.</p>
