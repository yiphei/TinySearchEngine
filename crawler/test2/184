<b>Effects of network trace sampling methods on privacy and utility
metrics</b>.

<p><b>Abstract:</b> Researchers studying computer networks rely on the availability
of traffic trace data collected from live production networks. Those choosing
to share trace data with colleagues must first remove or otherwise anonymize
sensitive information. This process, called sanitization, represents a
tradeoff between the removal of information in the interest of identity
protection and the preservation of data within the trace that is most
relevant to researchers. While several metrics exist to quantify this
privacy-utility tradeoff, they are often computationally expensive. Computing
these metrics using a sample of the trace, rather than the entire input
trace, could potentially save precious time and space resources, provided the
accuracy of these values does not suffer. In this paper, we examine several
simple sampling methods to discover their effects on measurement of the
privacy-utility tradeoff when anonymizing network traces prior to their
sharing or publication. After sanitizing a small sample trace collected from
the Dartmouth College wireless network, we tested the relative accuracy of a
variety of previously implemented packet and flow-sampling methods on a few
existing privacy and utility metrics. This analysis led us to conclude that,
for our test trace, no single sampling method we examined allowed us to
accurately measure the trade-off, and that some sampling methods can produce
grossly inaccurate estimates of those values. We were unable to draw
conclusions on the use of packet versus flow sampling in these instances.</p>
