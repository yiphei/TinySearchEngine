<p><b>Abstract:</b> Computer simulation is the most common approach to studying
wireless ad-hoc routing algorithms. The results, however, are only as good as
the models the simulation uses. One should not underestimate the importance
of  validation, as inaccurate models can lead to wrong conclusions. In
this paper, we use direct-execution simulation to validate radio models used
by ad-hoc routing protocols, against real-world experiments. This paper
documents a common testbed that supports direct execution of a set of ad-hoc
routing protocol implementations in a wireless network simulator. The testbed
reads traces generated from real experiments, and uses them to drive
direct-execution implementations of the routing protocols. Doing so we
reproduce the same network conditions as in real experiments. By comparing
routing behavior  measured in real experiments with behavior 
computed by the simulation, we are able to validate the models of radio
behavior upon which protocol behavior depends. We conclude that it is 
possible to have fairly accurate results using a simple radio model, but the
routing behavior is quite sensitive to one of this model's parameters. The
implication is that one should i) use a more complex radio model that
explicitly models point-to-point path loss, or ii) use measurements from an
environment typical of the one of interest, or iii) study behavior over a
range of environments to identify sensitivities.</p>
