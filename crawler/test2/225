<p><b>Abstract:</b> Location is an important feature for many applications, and
wireless networks can better serve their clients by anticipating client
mobility. As a result, many location predictors have been proposed in the
literature, though few have been evaluated with empirical evidence. This
paper reports on the results of the first extensive empirical evaluation of
location predictors, using a two-year trace of the mobility patterns of over
6,000 users on Dartmouth's campus-wide Wi-Fi wireless network. The surprising
results provide critical evidence for anyone designing or using mobility
predictors. <P> We implemented and compared the prediction accuracy of
several location predictors drawn from four major families of
domain-independent predictors, namely Markov-based, compression-based, PPM,
and SPM predictors. We found that low-order Markov predictors performed as
well or better than the more complex and more space-consuming
compression-based predictors.</p>
