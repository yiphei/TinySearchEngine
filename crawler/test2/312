<p><b>Abstract:</b> Information technology can improve the quality, efficiency, and
cost of healthcare. In this survey, we examine the privacy requirements of
mobile computing technologies that have the potential to transform
healthcare. Such mHealth technology enables physicians to remotely
monitor patients' health, and enables individuals to manage their own health
more easily. Despite these advantages, privacy is essential for any personal
monitoring technology. Through an extensive survey of the literature, we
develop a conceptual privacy framework for mHealth, itemize the privacy
properties needed in mHealth systems, and discuss the technologies that could
support privacy-sensitive mHealth systems. We end with a list of open
research questions.</p>
