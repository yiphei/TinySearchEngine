<b>The Changing Usage of a Mature Campus-wide Wireless Network</b>.

<p><b>Abstract:</b> Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs) are now common on academic
and corporate campuses. As ``Wi-Fi'' technology becomes ubiquitous, it is
increasingly important to understand trends in the usage of these networks.
This paper analyzes an extensive network trace from a mature 802.11 WLAN,
including more than 550 access points and 7000 users over seventeen weeks. We
employ several measurement techniques, including syslogs, telephone records,
SNMP polling and tcpdump packet sniffing. This is the largest WLAN study to
date, and the first to look at a large, mature WLAN and consider geographic
mobility. We compare this trace to a trace taken after the network's initial
deployment two years ago. <P> We found that the applications used on the
WLAN changed dramatically. Initial WLAN usage was dominated by Web traffic;
our new trace shows significant increases in peer-to-peer, streaming
multimedia, and voice over IP (VoIP) traffic. On-campus traffic now exceeds
off-campus traffic, a reversal of the situation at the WLAN's initial
deployment. Our study indicates that VoIP has been used little on the
wireless network thus far, and most VoIP calls are made on the wired network.
Most calls last less than a minute. <P> We saw more heterogeneity in the
types of clients used, with more embedded wireless devices such as PDAs and
mobile VoIP clients. We define a new metric for mobility, the ``session
diameter.'' We use this metric to show that embedded devices have different
mobility characteristics than laptops, and travel further and roam to more
access points. Overall, users were surprisingly non-mobile, with half
remaining close to home about 9837666460f the time.</p>
