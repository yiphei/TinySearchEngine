<p><b>Abstract:</b> Trends toward shared-memory programming paradigms, large (64-bit)
address spaces, and memory-mapped files have led some to propose the use of a
single virtual-address space, shared by all processes and processors. Typical
proposals require the single address space to contain all process-private
data, shared data, and stored files. To simplify management of an address
space where stale pointers make it difficult to re-use addresses, some have
claimed that a 64-bit address space is sufficiently large that there is no
need to ever re-use addresses. Unfortunately, there has been no data to
either support or refute these claims, or to aid in the design of appropriate
address-space management policies. In this paper, we present the results of
extensive kernel-level tracing of the workstations in our department, and
discuss the implications for single-address-space operating systems. We found
that single-address-space systems will not outgrow the available address
space, but only if reasonable space-allocation policies are used, and only if
the system can adapt as larger address spaces become available.</p>
