<p><b>Abstract:</b> In the context of our overall goal to bring the concepts of
parallel computing into the undergraduate curriculum, we set out to find a
parallel-programming language for student use. To make it accessible to
students at all levels, and to be independent of any particular hardware
platform, we chose to design our own language, based on a data-parallel model
and on C++. The result, DAPPLE, is a C++ class library designed to provide
the illusion of a data-parallel programming language on conventional hardware
and with conventional compilers. DAPPLE defines  Vectors and 
Matrices as basic classes, with all the usual C++ operators overloaded to
provide elementwise arithmetic. In addition, DAPPLE provides typical
data-parallel operations like scans, permutations, and reductions. Finally,
DAPPLE provides a parallel if-then-else statement to restrict the scope of
the above operations to partial vectors or matrices.</p>
