<p><b>Abstract:</b> Network researchers benefit tremendously from access to traces of
production networks, and several repositories of such network traces exist.
By their very nature, these traces capture sensitive business and personal
activity. Furthermore, network traces contain significant operational
information about the target network, such as its structure, identity of the
network provider, or addresses of important servers. To protect private or
proprietary information, researchers must ``sanitize'' a trace before sharing
it. <P> In this chapter, we survey the growing body of research that
addresses the risks, methods, and evaluation of network trace sanitization.
Research on the risks of network trace sanitization attempts to extract
information from published network traces, while research on sanitization
methods investigates approaches that may protect against such attacks.
Although researchers have recently proposed both quantitative and qualitative
methods to evaluate the effectiveness of sanitization methods, such work has
several shortcomings, some of which we highlight in a discussion of open
problems. Sanitizing a network trace, however challenging, remains an
important method for advancing network-based research.</p>
