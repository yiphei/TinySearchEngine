<b>An RPC Mechanism for Transportable Agents</b>.
Technical Report
PCS-TR96-280,
Dartmouth Computer Science,
March 
1996.
<p><b>Abstract:</b> Transportable agents are autonomous programs that migrate from
machine to machine, performing complex processing at each step to satisfy
client requests. As part of their duties agents often need to communicate
with other agents. We propose to use remote procedure call (RPC) along with a
flexible interface definition language (IDL), to add structure to inter-agent
communication. The real power of our Agent RPC comes from a client-server
binding mechanism based on flexible IDL matching and from support for
multiple simultaneous bindings. Our agents are programmed in Agent Tcl; we
describe how the Tcl implementation made RPC particularly easy to implement.
Finally, although our RPC is designed for Agent Tcl programs, the concepts
would also work for standard Tcl programs.</p>
