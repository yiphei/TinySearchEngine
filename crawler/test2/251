<p><b>Abstract:</b> Emerging pervasive computing technologies transform the way we
live and work by embedding computation in our surrounding environment. To
avoid increasing complexity, and allow the user to concentrate on her tasks,
applications in a pervasive computing environment must automatically adapt to
their changing  context, including the user state and the physical and
computational environment in which they run. Solar is a middleware platform
to help these ``context-aware'' applications aggregate desired context from
heterogeneous sources and to locate environmental services depending on the
current context. By moving most of the context computation into the
infrastructure, Solar allows applications to run on thin mobile clients more
effectively. By providing an open framework to enable dynamic injection of
context processing modules, Solar shares these modules across many
applications, reducing application development cost and network traffic. By
distributing these modules across network nodes and reconfiguring the
distribution at runtime, Solar achieves parallelism and online load
balancing.</p>
