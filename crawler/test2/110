<p><b>Abstract:</b> High-performance computing increasingly occurs on ``computational
grids'' composed of heterogeneous and geographically distributed systems of
computers, networks, and storage devices that collectively act as a single
``virtual'' computer. A key challenge in this environment is to provide
efficient access to data distributed across remote data servers. Our parallel
I/O framework, called Armada, allows application and data-set providers to
flexibly compose graphs of processing modules that describe the distribution,
application interfaces, and processing required of the dataset before
computation. Although the framework provides a simple programming model for
the application programmer and the data-set provider, the resulting graph may
contain bottlenecks that prevent efficient data access. In this paper, we
present an algorithm used to restructure Armada graphs that distributes
computation and data flow to improve performance in the context of a
wide-area computational grid.</p>
