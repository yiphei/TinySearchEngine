<p><b>Abstract:</b> In a network, bridging nodes are those nodes that from a
topological perspective, are strategically located between highly connected
regions of nodes. Thus, they have high values of the Bridging Centrality (BC)
metric. We recently introduced the Localized Bridging Centrality (LBC)
metric, which can identify such nodes via distributed computation, yet has an
accuracy equal to that of the centralized BC metric. The LBC and BC metrics
are based on the Social Network Analysis (SNA) metric "betweenness
centrality". We now introduce a new SNA metric that is more suitable for use
in wireless mesh networks: the Localized Load-aware Bridging Centrality
(LLBC) metric. The LLBC metric improves upon LBC by detecting critical
bridging nodes while taking into account the actual traffic flows present in
a mesh network. We only use local information from surrounding nodes to
compute the LLBC metric, thus our LLBC metric is designed for scalable
distributed computation and distributed network analysis. We developed the
SNA Plugin (SNAP) for the Optimized Link State Routing (OLSR) protocol to
study the potential use of LBC and LLBC in improving multicast
communications. We present some promising initial results for SNAP from real
and emulated mesh networks. SNAP is open source and free for academic use.</p>
