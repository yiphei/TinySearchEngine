<b>Privacy Analysis of User Association Logs in a Large-scale Wireless
LAN</b>.
Technical Report

Dartmouth Computer Science,
January

<p><b>Abstract:</b> User association logs collected from a large-scale wireless LAN
record where and when a user has used the network. Such information plays an
important role in wireless network research. One concern of sharing these
data with other researchers, however, is that the logs pose potential privacy
risks for the network users. Today, the common practice in sanitizing these
data before releasing them to the public is to anonymize users' sensitive
information, such as their devices' MAC addresses and their exact association
locations. In this work, we demonstrate that such sanitization measures are
insufficient to protect user privacy because the differences between user
association behaviors can be modeled and many are distinguishable. By
simulating an adversary's role, we propose a novel type of correlation attack
in which the adversary uses the anonymized association log to build
signatures against each user, and when combined with auxiliary information,
such signatures can help to identify users within the anonymized log. On a
user association log that contains more than four thousand users and millions
of association records, we demonstrate that this attack technique is able to
pinpoint the victim's identity exactly with a probability as high as 70%, and
narrow it down to a set of 20 candidates with a probability close to 100%.0 We
further evaluate the effectiveness of standard anonymization techniques,
including generalization and perturbation, in mitigating this correlation
attack; our experimental results reveal only limited success of these
methods, suggesting that more thorough treatment is needed when anonymizing
wireless user association logs before public release.</p>
