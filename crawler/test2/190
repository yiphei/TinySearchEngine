<b>Problems with the Dartmouth wireless SNMP data collection</b>.
Technical Report
TR2003-480,
Dartmouth Computer Science,
December 
2003.
<p><b>Abstract:</b> The original Dartmouth wireless network study used SNMP to query
the college's Cisco 802.11b access points. The perl scripts that performed
the SNMP queries suffered from some problems, in that they queried
inappropriate SNMP values, or misunderstood the meaning of other values. This
data was also used in a subsequent analysis. The same scripts were used to
collect data for a subsequent study of another wireless network. This
document outlines these problems and indicates which of the data collected by
the original scripts may be invalid.</p>
