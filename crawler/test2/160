<b>Outdoor Experimental Comparison of Four Ad Hoc Routing Algorithms</b>.
Technical Report
TR2004-511,
Dartmouth Computer Science,
2004.
<p><b>Abstract:</b> Most comparisons of wireless ad hoc routing algorithms involve
simulated or indoor trial runs, or outdoor runs with only a small number of
nodes, potentially leading to an incorrect picture of algorithm performance.
In this paper, we report on the results of an outdoor trial run of four
different routing algorithms, APRL, AODV, GPSR, and STARA, running on top of
thirty-three 802.11-enabled laptops moving randomly through an athletic
field. The laptops generated random traffic according to the traffic patterns
observed in a prototype application, and ran each routing algorithm for a
fifteen-minute period over the course of the hour-long trial run. The
33-laptop experiment represents one of the largest outdoor tests of wireless
routing algorithms, and three of the algorithms each come from a different
algorithmic class, providing insight into the behavior of ad hoc routing
algorithms at larger real-world scales than have been considered so far. In
addition, we compare the outdoor results with both indoor ("tabletop") and
simulation results for the same algorithms, examining the differences between
the indoor results and the outdoor reality. The paper also describes the
software infrastructure that allowed us to implement the ad hoc routing
algorithms in a comparable way, and use the same codebase for indoor,
outdoor, and simulated trial runs.</p>
