<p><b>Abstract:</b> There is increasing interest in location-aware systems and
applications. It is important for any designer of such systems and
applications to understand the nature of user and device mobility.
Furthermore, an understanding of the effect of user mobility on access points
(APs) is also important for designing, deploying, and managing wireless
networks. Although various studies of wireless networks have provided
insights into different network environments and user groups, it is often
hard to apply these findings to other situations, or to derive useful
abstract models. <P> In this paper, we present a general methodology for
extracting mobility information from wireless network traces, and for
classifying mobile users and APs. We used the Fourier transform to convert
time-dependent location information to the frequency domain, then chose the
two strongest periods and used them as parameters to a classification system
based on Bayesian theory. To classify mobile users, we computed diameter (the
maximum distance between any two APs visited by a user during a fixed time
period) and observed how this quantity changes or repeats over time. We found
that user mobility had a strong period of one day, but there was also a large
group of users that had either a much smaller or much bigger primary period.
Both primary and secondary periods had important roles in determining classes
of mobile users. Users with one day as their primary period and a smaller
secondary period were most prevalent; we expect that they were mostly
students taking regular classes. To classify APs, we counted the number of
users visited each AP. The primary period did not play a critical role
because it was equal to one day for most of the APs; the secondary period was
the determining parameter. APs with one day as their primary period and one
week as their secondary period were most prevalent. By plotting the classes
of APs on our campus map, we discovered that this periodic behavior of APs
seemed to be independent of their geographical locations, but may depend on
the relative locations of nearby APs. Ultimately, we hope that our study can
help the design of location-aware services by providing a base for user
mobility models that reflect the movements of real users.</p>
