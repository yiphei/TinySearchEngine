<p><b>Abstract:</b> Computer simulation has been used extensively as an effective
tool in the design and evaluation of systems. One should not, however,
underestimate the importance of validation-- the process of ensuring whether
a simulation model is an appropriate representation of the real-world system.
Validation of wireless network simulations is difficult due to strong
interdependencies among protocols at different layers and uncertainty in the
wireless environment. The authors present an approach of coupling
direct-execution simulation and traces from real outdoor experiments to
validating simple wireless models that are used commonly in simulations of
wireless ad hoc networks. This article documents a common testbed that
supports direct execution of a set of ad hoc routing protocol implementations
in a wireless network simulator. By comparing routing behavior measured in
the real experiment with behavior computed by the simulation, the authors
validate the models of radio behavior upon which protocol behavior depends.</p>
