<p><b>Abstract:</b> Common authentication methods based on passwords, tokens, or
fingerprints perform one-time authentication and rely on users to log out
from the computer terminal when they leave. Users often do not log out,
however, which is a security risk. The most common solution, inactivity
timeouts, inevitably fail security (too long a timeout) or usability (too
short a timeout) goals. One solution is to authenticate users continuously
while they are using the terminal and automatically log them out when they
leave. Several solutions are based on user proximity, but these are not
sufficient: they only confirm whether the user is nearby but not whether the
user is actually using the terminal. Proposed solutions based on behavioral
biometric authentication (e.g., keystroke dynamics) may not be reliable, as a
recent study suggests. <P> To address this problem we propose ZEBRA. In
ZEBRA, a user wears a bracelet (with a built-in accelerometer, gyroscope, and
radio) on her dominant wrist. When the user interacts with a computer
terminal, the bracelet records the wrist movement, processes it, and sends it
to the terminal. The terminal compares the wrist movement with the inputs it
receives from the user (via keyboard and mouse), and confirms the continued
presence of the user only if they correlate. Because the bracelet is on the
same hand that provides inputs to the terminal, the accelerometer and
gyroscope data and input events received by the terminal should correlate
because their source is the same&nbsp;- the user's hand movement. In our
experiments ZEBRA performed continuous authentication with 85 0x0.07fd95a58d8bp-1022ccuracy in
verifying the correct user and identified all adversaries within 11&nbsp;s. For a
different threshold that trades security for usability, ZEBRA correctly
verified 9037665000f users and identified all adversaries within 50&nbsp;s.</p>
