<b>Can I access your Data? Privacy Management in mHealth</b>.

<i>USENIX Workshop on Health Security (HealthSec)</i>,
August 
2010.
Position paper.
<p><b>Abstract:</b> Mobile health (mHealth) has become important in the field of
healthcare information technology, as patients begin to use mobile medical
sensors to record their daily activities and vital signs. Since their medical
data is collected by their sensors, the patients may wish to control data
collection and distribution, so as to protect their data and share it only
when the need arises. It must be possible for patients to grant or deny
access to the data on the storage unit (mobile phones or personal health
records (PHR)). Thus, an efficient framework is required for managing patient
consent electronically, i.e.to allow patients to express their desires about
what data to collect, what to store, and how to share. We describe several
challenges posed by privacy management in mobile health.</p>
