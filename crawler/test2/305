<b>Sensor-based system for verifying blood-pressure measurement
position</b>.

<p><b>Abstract:</b> Mobile maternal-health programs send workers door to door to
visit pregnant women in rural India and collect data such as blood pressure
or weight, then send that data to doctors for review. Since the doctors do
not see the data collection, ensuring correct collection methods is crucial
to allow them to make good treatment decisions. However, blood-pressure
measurements are sometimes taken with the patient's arm in the wrong
position, which can cause inaccurate readings. This paper describes a system
consisting of an automatic blood pressure cuff with an accelerometer and
force sensors attached to determine whether the arm is at the correct angle,
held still, and properly supported. A user study indicated that the prototype
was effective in helping untrained users take a measurement in the correct
position.</p>
