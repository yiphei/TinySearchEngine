<p><b>Abstract:</b> Understanding usage patterns in wireless local-area networks
(WLANs) is critical for those who develop, deploy, and manage WLAN
technology, as well as those who develop systems and application software for
wireless networks. This paper presents results from the largest and most
comprehensive trace of network activity in a large, production wireless LAN.
For eleven weeks we traced the activity of nearly two thousand users drawn
from a general campus population, using a campus-wide network of 476 access
points spread over 161 buildings. Our study expands on those done by Tang and
Baker, with a significantly larger and broader population. <P> We found that
residential traffic dominated all other traffic, particularly in residences
populated by newer students; students are increasingly choosing a wireless
laptop as their primary computer. Although web protocols were the single
largest component of traffic volume, network backup and file sharing
contributed an unexpectedly large amount to the traffic. Although there was
some roaming within a network session, we were surprised by the number of
situations in which cards roamed excessively, unable to settle on one access
point. Cross-subnet roams were an especial problem, because they broke IP
connections, indicating the need for solutions that avoid or accommodate such
roams.</p>
