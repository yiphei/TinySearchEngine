<b>User survey regarding the needs of network researchers in
trace-anonymization tools</b>.
Technical Report
TR2009-658,
Dartmouth Computer Science,
November 
2009.
<p><b>Abstract:</b> To understand the needs of network researchers in an
anonymization tool, we conducted a survey on the network researchers. We
invited network researchers world-wide to the survey by sending invitation
emails to well-known mailing lists whose subscribers may be interested in
network research with collecting, sharing and sanitizing network traces.</p>
