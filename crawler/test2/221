<b>Evaluating location predictors with extensive Wi-Fi mobility
data</b>.
Technical Report

Dartmouth Computer Science,
February 
2004.
<p><b>Abstract:</b> Location is an important feature for many applications, and
wireless networks may serve their clients better by anticipating client
mobility. As a result, many location predictors have been proposed in the
literature, though few have been evaluated with empirical evidence. This
paper reports on the results of the first extensive empirical evaluation of
location predictors using a two-year trace of the mobility patterns of more
than 6,000 users on Dartmouth's campus-wide Wi-Fi wireless network. The
surprising results provide critical evidence for anyone designing or using
mobility predictors. We implemented and compared the prediction accuracy of
several location predictors drawn from four major families of
domain-independent predictors, namely, Markov-based, compression-based, PPM,
and SPM predictors. We found that low-order Markov predictors performed as
well or better than the more complex and more space-consuming
compression-based predictors.</p>
