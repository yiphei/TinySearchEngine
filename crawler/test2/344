<b>StressAware: An App for Real-Time Stress Monitoring on the
Amulet Wearable Platform</b>.

<p><b>Abstract:</b> Stress is the root cause of many diseases and unhealthy
behaviors. Being able to monitor when and why a person is stressed could
inform personal stress management as well as interventions when necessary. In
this work, we present StressAware, an application on the Amulet wearable
platform that classifies the stress level (low, medium, high) of individuals
continuously and in real time using heart rate (HR) and heartrate variability
(HRV) data from a commercial heart-rate monitor. We developed our
stress-detection model using a Support Vector Machine (SVM). We trained and
tested our model using data from three sources and had the following
preliminary results: PhysioNet, a public physiological database (94.5%
accurate with 10-fold cross validation), a field study (100 0x0.07fd95a58d8bp-1022ccurate with
10-fold cross validation) and a lab study (64.3 0x0p+0ccurate with leave-one-out
cross-validation). Testing the StressAware app revealed a projected battery
life of up to 12 days. Also, the usability feedback from subjects showed that
the Amulet has a potential to be used by people for monitoring their stress
levels. The results are promising, indicating that the app may be used for
stress detection, and eventually for the development of stress-related
intervention that could improve the health of individuals.</p>
