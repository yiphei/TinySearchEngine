<p><b>Abstract:</b> Efficient and reliable dissemination of information over a large
area is a critical ability of a sensor network for various reasons such as
software updates and transferring large data objects (e.g., surveillance
images). Thus efficiency of wireless broadcast is an important aspect of
sensor network deployment. In this paper, we study FBcast, a new broadcast
protocol based on the principles of modern erasure codes. We show that our
approach provides high reliability, often considered critical for
disseminating codes. In addition FBcast offers limited data confidentiality.
For a large network, where every node may not be reachable by the source, we
extend FBcast with the idea of repeaters to improve reliable coverage.
Simulation results on TOSSIM show that FBcast offers higher reliability with
lower number of retransmissions than traditional broadcasts.</p>
