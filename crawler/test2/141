<b>Mobile Agents for Distributed Information Retrieval</b>.

<p><b>Abstract:</b> A mobile agent is an executing program that can migrate during
execution from machine to machine in a heterogeneous network. On each
machine, the agent interacts with stationary service agents and other
resources to accomplish its task. Mobile agents are particularly attractive
in distributed information-retrieval applications. By moving to the location
of an information resource, the agent can search the resource locally,
eliminating the transfer of intermediate results across the network and
reducing end-to-end latency. In this chapter, we first discuss the strengths
of mobile agents, and argue that although none of these strengths are unique
to mobile agents, no competing technique shares all of them. Next, after
surveying several representative mobile-agent systems, we examine one
specific information-retrieval application, searching distributed collections
of technical reports, and consider how mobile agents can be used to implement
this application efficiently and easily. Then we spend the bulk of the
chapter describing two planning services that allow mobile agents to deal
with dynamic network environments and information resources: (1) planning
algorithms that let an agent choose the best migration path through the
network, given its current task and the current network conditions, and (2)
planning algorithms that tell an agent how to observe a changing set of
documents in a way that detects changes as soon as possible while minimizing
overhead. Finally, we consider the types of errors that can occur when
information from multiple sources is merged and filtered, and argue that the
structure of a mobile-agent application determines the extent to which these
errors affect the final result.</p>
