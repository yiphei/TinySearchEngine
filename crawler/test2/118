<b>A Game-Theoretic Formulation of Multi-Agent Resource Allocation</b>.
Technical Report
PCS-TR99-360,
Dartmouth Computer Science,
October 
1999.
<p><b>Abstract:</b> This paper considers resource allocation in a network with mobile
agents competing for computational priority. We formulate this problem as a
multi-agent game with the players being agents purchasing service from a
common server. We show that there exists a computable Nash equilibrium when
agents have perfect information into the future. We simulate a network of
hosts and agents using our strategy to show that our resource-allocation
mechanism effectively prioritizes agents according to their endowments.</p>
