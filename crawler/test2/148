<p><b>Abstract:</b> Building applications with mobile agents often reduces the
bandwidth required for the application, and improves performance. The cost is
increased server workload. There are, however, few studies of the scalability
of mobile-agent systems. We present scalability experiments that compare four
mobile-agent platforms with a traditional client/server approach. The four
mobile-agent platforms have similar behavior, but their absolute performance
varies with underlying implementation choices. Our experiments demonstrate
the complex interaction between environmental, application, and system
parameters.</p>
