<p><b>Abstract:</b> Mobile-agent systems allow applications to distribute their
resource consumption across the network. By prioritizing applications and
publishing the cost of actions, it is possible for applications to achieve
faster performance than in an environment where resources are evenly shared.
We enforce the costs of actions through markets where user applications bid
for computation from host machines. <P> We represent applications as
collections of mobile agents and introduce a distributed mechanism for
allocating general computational priority to mobile agents. We derive a
bidding strategy for an agent that plans expenditures given a budget and a
series of tasks to complete. We also show that a unique Nash equilibrium
exists between the agents under our allocation policy. We present simulation
results to show that the use of our resource-allocation mechanism and
expenditure-planning algorithm results in shorter mean job completion times
compared to traditional mobile-agent resource allocation. We also observe
that our resource-allocation policy adapts favorably to allocate overloaded
resources to higher priority agents, and that agents are able to effectively
plan expenditures even when faced with network delay and job-size estimation
error.</p>
