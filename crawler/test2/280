<p><b>Abstract:</b> As location-aware and pervasive computing technologies become
more prevalent, privacy concerns are becoming increasingly more important.
User preferences about location privacy may depend on place, not only in
terms of their physical location but also in terms of their social context:
how they define where they are, what they are doing, and whom they are with
at the time. Using the experience sampling method, the authors explored the
privacy preferences of 25 users during one week. They found that participants
were more willing to share location information when at home or alone than
when at other locations or with friends. Most participants were consistent in
their location privacy preferences across requester categories and regardless
of place. Some participants, however, varied in their willingness to share
location information depending on where they were, who they were with, and
who was requesting the information. Those participants tended to be more
concerned about privacy in general. These findings are useful for designing
future privacy policies and user interfaces for pervasive computing. This
article is part of a special issue on security and privacy.</p>
