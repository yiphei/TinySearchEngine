<b>Snowflake: Spanning Administrative Domains</b>.
Technical Report
PCS-TR98-343,
Dartmouth Computer Science,
December 
1998.
<p><b>Abstract:</b> Many distributed systems provide a ``single-system image'' to
their users, so the user has the illusion that they are using a single system
when in fact they are using many distributed resources. It is a powerful
abstraction that helps users to manage the complexity of using distributed
resources. The goal of the Snowflake project is to discover how single-system
images can be made to span administrative domains. Our current prototype
organizes resources in namespaces and distributes them using Java Remote
Method Invocation. Challenging issues include how much flexibility should be
built into the namespace interface, and how transparent the network and
persistent storage should be. We outline future work on making Snowflake
administrator-friendly.</p>
