<p><b>Abstract:</b> We evaluate mobility predictors in wireless networks. Handoff
prediction in wireless networks has long been considered as a mechanism to
improve the quality of service provided to mobile wireless users. Most prior
studies, however, were based on theoretical analysis, simulation with
synthetic mobility models, or small wireless network traces. We study the
effect of mobility prediction for a large realistic wireless situation. We
tackle the problem by using traces collected from a large production wireless
network to evaluate several major families of handoff-location prediction
techniques, a set of handoff-time predictors, and a predictor that jointly
predicts handoff location and time. We also propose a fallback mechanism,
which uses a lower-order predictor whenever a higher-order predictor fails to
predict. We found that low-order Markov predictors, with our proposed
fallback mechanisms, performed as well or better than the more complex and
more space-consuming compression-based handoff-location predictors. Although
our handoff-time predictor had modest prediction accuracy, in the context of
mobile voice applications we found that bandwidth reservation strategies can
benefit from the combined location and time handoff predictor, significantly
reducing the call-drop rate without significantly increasing the call-block
rate. We also developed a prediction-based routing protocol for mobile
opportunistic networks. We evaluated and compared our protocol's performance
to five existing routing protocols, using simulations driven by real mobility
traces. We found that the basic routing protocols are not practical for
large-scale opportunistic networks. Prediction-based routing protocols trade
off the message delivery ratio against resource usage and performed well and
comparable to each other.</p>
