<p><b>Abstract:</b> Modern distributed systems scatter sensors, storage, and
computation throughout the environment. Ideally these devices communicate and
share resources, but there is seldom motivation for a device's owner to yield
control to another user. We establish markets for computational resources to
motivate principals to share resources with arbitrary users, to enforce
priority in distributed systems, to provide flexible and rational limitations
on the potential of an application, and to provide a lightweight structure to
balance the workload over time and between devices. As proof of concept, we
implement a structure software agents can use to discover and negotiate
access to networked resources. The structure separates discovery,
authentication, and consumption enforcement as separate orthogonal issues to
give system designers flexibility. <P> Mobile agents represent informational
and computational flow. We develop mechanisms that distributively allocate
computation among mobile agents in two settings. The first models a situation
where users collectively own networked computing resources and require
priority enforcement. We extend the allocation mechanism to allow resource
reservation to mitigate utility volatility. The second, more general model
relaxes the ownership assumption. We apply our computational market to an
open setting where a principal's chief concern is revenue maximization. <P>
Our simulations compare the performance of market-based allocation policies
to traditional policies and relate the cost of ownership and consumption
separation. We observe that our markets effectively prioritize applications'
performance, can operate under uncertainty and network delay, provide metrics
to balance network load, and allow measurement of market-participation risk
versus reservation-based computation. <P> In addition to allocation
problems, we investigate resource selection to optimize execution time. The
problem is NP-complete if the costs and latencies are constant. Both metrics'
dependence on the chosen set complicates matters. We study how a greedy
approach, a novel heuristic, and a shortest-constrained-path strategy perform
in mobile-agent applications. <P> Market-based computational-resource
allocation fertilizes applications where previously there was a dearth of
motive for or means of cooperation. The rationale behind mobile-agent
performance optimization is also useful for resource allocation in general
distributed systems where an application has a sequence of dependent tasks or
when data collection is expensive.</p>
