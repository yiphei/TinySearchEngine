<b>A Case Study of Four Location Traces</b>.
Technical Report

<p><b>Abstract:</b> Location is one of the most important context information that an
ubiquitous-computing application may leverage. Thus understanding the
location systems and how location-aware applications interact with them is
critical for design and deployment of both the location systems and
location-aware applications. In this paper, we analyze a set of traces
collected from two small-scale one-building location system and two
large-scale campus-wide location systems. Our goal is to study
characteristics of these location systems ant how these factors should be
taken into account by a potentially large number of location-aware
applications with different needs. We make empirical measurements of several
important metrics and compare the results across these location systems. We
discuss the implication of these results on location-aware applications and
their supporting software infrastructure, and how location systems could be
improved to better serve applications' needs. In places where possible, we
use location-aware applications discussed in existing literatures as
illustrating examples.</p>
