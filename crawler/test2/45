<p><b>Abstract:</b> Several algorithms for parallel disk systems have appeared in the
literature recently, and they are asymptotically optimal in terms of the
number of disk accesses. Scalable systems with parallel disks must be able to
run these algorithms. We present a list of capabilities that must be provided
by the system to support these optimal algorithms: control over declustering,
querying about the configuration, independent I/O, turning off file caching
and prefetching, and bypassing parity. We summarize recent theoretical and
empirical work that justifies the need for these capabilities.</p>
