<p><b>Abstract:</b> As healthcare in many countries faces an aging population and
rising costs, mobile sensing technologies promise a new opportunity. Using
mobile health (mHealth) sensing, which uses medical sensors to collect data
about the patients, and mobile phones to act as a gateway between sensors and
electronic health record systems, caregivers can continuously monitor the
patients and deliver better care. Furthermore, individuals can become better
engaged in monitoring and managing their own health. Although some work on
mHealth sensing has addressed security, achieving strong privacy for
low-power sensors remains a challenge. We make three contributions. First, we
propose an mHealth sensing protocol that provides strong security and privacy
properties at the link layer, with low energy overhead, suitable for
low-power sensors. The protocol uses three novel techniques: adaptive
security, to dynamically modify transmission overhead; MAC striping, to make
forgery difficult even for small-sized Message Authentication Codes; and
asymmetric resource requirements, in recognition of the limited resources in
tiny mHealth sensors. Second, we demonstrate its feasibility by implementing
a prototype on a Chronos wrist device, and evaluating it experimentally.
Third, we provide a security, privacy, and energy analysis of our system.</p>
