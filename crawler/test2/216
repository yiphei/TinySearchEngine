<p><b>Abstract:</b> The edge of the Internet is increasingly becoming wireless.
Understanding the wireless edge is therefore important for understanding the
performance and security aspects of the Internet experience. This need is
especially necessary for enterprise-wide wireless local-area networks (WLANs)
as organizations increasingly depend on WLANs for mission-critical tasks. To
study a live production WLAN, especially a large-scale network, is a
difficult undertaking. Two fundamental difficulties involved are (1) building
a scalable network measurement infrastructure to collect traces from a
large-scale production WLAN, and (2) preserving user privacy while sharing
these collected traces to the network research community. In this
dissertation, we present our experience in designing and implementing one of
the largest distributed WLAN measurement systems in the United States, the
Dartmouth Internet Security Testbed (DIST), with a particular focus on our
solutions to the challenges of efficiency, scalability, and security. We also
present an extensive evaluation of the DIST system. To understand the
severity of some potential trace-sharing risks for an enterprise-wide
large-scale wireless network, we conduct privacy analysis on one kind of
wireless network traces, a user-association log, collected from a large-scale
WLAN. We introduce a machine-learning based approach that can extract and
quantify sensitive information from a user-association log, even though it is
sanitized. Finally, we present a case study that evaluates the tradeoff
between utility and privacy on WLAN trace sanitization.</p>
