<p><b>Abstract:</b> Traditional mobile ad&nbsp;hoc network (MANET) routing protocols
assume that contemporaneous end-to-end communication paths exist between data
senders and receivers. In some mobile ad&nbsp;hoc networks with a sparse node
population, an end-to-end communication path may break frequently or may not
exist at any time. Many routing protocols have been proposed in the
literature to address the problem, but few were evaluated in a realistic
``opportunistic'' network setting. We use simulation and contact traces
(derived from logs in a production network) to evaluate and compare five
existing protocols: direct-delivery, epidemic, random, PRoPHET, and
Link-State, as well as our own proposed routing protocol. We show that the
direct delivery and epidemic routing protocols suffer either low delivery
ratio or high resource usage, and other protocols make tradeoffs between
delivery ratio and resource usage.</p>
