<p><b>Abstract:</b> The ubiquity of smartphones and mobile and wearable devices allow
people to collect information about their health, wellness and lifestyle and
share with others. If it is not clear what they need to share to receive
benefits, subjects (people whose information is collected) might share
too much, thus disclosing unnecessary private information. On the other hand,
concerned about disclosing personal information, subjects might share less
than what the recipient needs and lose the opportunity to enjoy the benefits.
This balance of disclosure and utility is important when the subject wants to
receive some benefits, but is concerned about disclosing private information.
<P> We address this problem of balancing disclosure and utility of personal
information collected by mobile technologies. We believe subjects can decide
how best to share their information if they are aware of the benefits and
risks of sharing. We developed ShareBuddy, a privacy-aware architecture that
allows recipients to request information and specify the benefits the
subjects will receive for sharing each piece of requested information; the
architecture displays these benefits and warns subjects about the risks of
sharing. We describe the ShareBuddy architecture in this poster.</p>
