<p><b>Abstract:</b> Building a campus-wide wireless LAN measurement system faces many
efficiency, scalability and security challenges. To address these challenges,
we developed a distributed Wi-Fi sniffing program called Saluki. Compared to
our previous implementation and to other available sniffing programs, Saluki
has the following advantages: (1)&nbsp;its small footprint makes it suitable for a
resource-constrained Linux platform, such as those in commercial Wi-Fi access
points; (2)&nbsp;the frame-capture rate increased more than three-fold over
tcpdump with minimal frame loss; (3)&nbsp;all traffic between this sniffer and the
back-end server was secured using 128-bit encryption; and (4)&nbsp;the traffic
load on the backbone network was reduced to only 3037666460f that in our previous
implementation. In this paper, we introduce the design and the implementation
details of this high-performance sniffing program, along with preliminary
evaluation results.</p>
