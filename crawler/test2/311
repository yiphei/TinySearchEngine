<p><b>Abstract:</b> Wearable devices&nbsp;- like the FitBit, MOTOACTV, and Jawbone UP&nbsp;-
are increasingly becoming more pervasive whether for monitoring health and
fitness, personal assistance, or home automation. While pervasive wearable
devices have long been researched, we are now beginning to see the fruits of
this research in the form of commercial offerings. Today, many of these
commercial wearable devices are closed systems that do not interoperate with
other devices a person might carry. We believe, however, these commercial
offerings signal the coming of wireless body-area networks that will connect
these pervasive wearable devices and leverage existing devices a user already
owns (e.g., a smartphone). Such wireless body-area networks will allow
devices to specialize and utilize the capabilities of other devices in the
network. A sensor, for example, might harness the internet connectivity of a
smartphone to store its data in the cloud. Utilized in this way, devices will
become cheaper because they will only require the components necessary for
their speciality, and they will also become more pervasive because they can
easily be shared between users. <P> In order for such a vision to be
successful, these devices will need to seamlessly interoperate with no
interaction required of the user. As difficult as it is for users to manage
their wireless area networks, it will be even more difficult for a user to
manage their wireless body-area network in a truly pervasive world. As such,
we believe these wearable devices should form a wireless body-area network
that is passive in nature. This means that these pervasive wearable devices
will require no configuration, yet they will be able form a wireless
body-area network by (1) discovering their peers, (2) recognizing they are
attached to the same body, (3) securing their communications, and (4)
identifying to whom they are attached. While we are interested in all aspects
of these passive wireless body-area networks, we focus on the last
requirement: identifying who is wearing a device.</p>
