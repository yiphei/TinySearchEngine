<p><b>Abstract:</b> The problem of providing file I/O to parallel programs has been
largely neglected in the development of multiprocessor systems. There are two
essential elements of any file system design intended for a highly parallel
environment: parallel I/O and effective caching schemes. This paper
concentrates on the second aspect of file system design and specifically, on
the question of whether prefetching blocks of the file into the block cache
can effectively reduce overall execution time of a parallel computation, even
under favorable assumptions. <P> Experiments have been conducted with an
interleaved file system testbed on the Butterfly Plus multiprocessor. Results
of these experiments suggest that 1) the hit ratio, the accepted measure in
traditional caching studies, may not be an adequate measure of performance
when the workload consists of parallel computations and parallel file access
patterns, 2) caching with prefetching can significantly improve the hit ratio
and the average time to perform an I/O operation, and 3) an improvement in
overall execution time has been observed in most cases. In spite of these
gains, prefetching sometimes results in increased execution times (a negative
result, given the optimistic nature of the study). <P> We explore why is it
not trivial to translate savings on individual I/O requests into consistently
better overall performance and identify the key problems that need to be
addressed in order to improve the potential of prefetching techniques in this
environment.</p>
