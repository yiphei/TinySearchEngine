<b>Mesh-Mon: a Monitoring and Management System for Wireless Mesh

<p><b>Abstract:</b> A mesh network is a network of wireless routers that employ
multi-hop routing and can be used to provide network access for mobile
clients. Mobile mesh networks can be deployed rapidly to provide an alternate
communication infrastructure for emergency response operations in areas with
limited or damaged infrastructure. <P> In this dissertation, we present
Dart-Mesh: a Linux-based layer-3 dual-radio two-tiered mesh network that
provides complete 802.11b coverage in the Sudikoff Lab for Computer Science
at Dartmouth College. We faced several challenges in building, testing,
monitoring and managing this network. These challenges motivated us to design
and implement Mesh-Mon, a network monitoring system to aid system
administrators in the management of a mobile mesh network. Mesh-Mon is a
scalable, distributed and decentralized management system in which mesh nodes
cooperate in a proactive manner to help detect, diagnose and resolve network
problems automatically. Mesh-Mon is independent of the routing protocol used
by the mesh routing layer and can function even if the routing protocol
fails. We demonstrate this feature by running Mesh-Mon on two versions of
Dart-Mesh, one running on AODV (a reactive mesh routing protocol) and the
second running on OLSR (a proactive mesh routing protocol) in separate
experiments. <P> Mobility can cause links to break, leading to disconnected
partitions. We identify critical nodes in the network, whose failure may
cause a partition. We introduce two new metrics based on social-network
analysis: the Localized Bridging Centrality (LBC) metric and the Localized
Load-aware Bridging Centrality (LLBC) metric, that can identify critical
nodes efficiently and in a fully distributed manner. <P> We run a monitoring
component on client nodes, called Mesh-Mon-Ami, which also assists Mesh-Mon
nodes in the dissemination of management information between physically
disconnected partitions, by acting as carriers for management data. <P> We
conclude, from our experimental evaluation on our 16-node Dart-Mesh testbed,
that our system solves several management challenges in a scalable manner,
and is a useful and effective tool for monitoring and managing real-world
mesh networks.</p>
