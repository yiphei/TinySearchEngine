<p><b>Abstract:</b> Mobile computers have become increasingly popular as users
discover the benefits of having their electronic work available at all times.
However, because network conditions vary from connection to connection, using
Internet resources from a mobile platform is a major challenge. Mobile agents
are one solution. A mobile agent is an autonomous program that can move from
machine to machine in a heterogeneous network under its own control. It can
suspend its execution at any point, transport itself to a new machine, and
resume execution on the new machine from the point at which it left off. On
each machine, it interacts with service agents and other resources to
accomplish its task, returning to its home site with a final result when that
task is finished. <P> Agent Tcl is a mobile-agent system whose agents can be
written in Tcl, Java, and Scheme. Agent Tcl has extensive navigation and
communication services, security mechanisms, and debugging and tracking
tools. In this article we focus on Agent Tcl's architecture and security
mechanisms, its RPC system, and its docking system, which lets an agent move
transparently among mobile computers, regardless of when they are connected
to the network.</p>
