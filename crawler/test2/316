<p><b>Abstract:</b> Information technology (IT) has great potential to improve
healthcare quality while also improving efficiency, and thus has been a major
focus of recent healthcare reform efforts. However, developing, deploying and
using IT that is both secure and genuinely effective in the complex clinical,
organizational and economic environment of healthcare is a significant
challenge. Further, it is imperative that we better understand the privacy
concerns of patients and providers, as well as the ability of current
technologies, policies, and laws to adequately protect privacy. The Securing
Information Technology in Healthcare (SITH) workshops were created to provide
a forum to discuss security and privacy for experts from a broad range of
perspectives, from officers at large healthcare companies, startups and
nonprofits, to physicians, researchers and policy makers.</p>
