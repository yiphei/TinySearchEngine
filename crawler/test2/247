<b>A Survey of Context-Aware Mobile Computing Research</b>.
Technical Report
TR2000-381,
Dartmouth Computer Science,
November 
2000.
<p><b>Abstract:</b> Context-aware computing is a mobile computing paradigm in which
applications can discover and take advantage of contextual information (such
as user location, time of day, nearby people and devices, and user activity).
Since it was proposed about a decade ago, many researchers have studied this
topic and built several context-aware applications to demonstrate the
usefulness of this new technology. Context-aware applications (or the system
infrastructure to support them), however, have never been widely available to
everyday users. In this survey of research on context-aware systems and
applications, we looked in depth at the types of context used and models of
context information, at systems that support collecting and disseminating
context, and at applications that adapt to the changing context. Through this
survey, it is clear that context-aware research is an old but rich area for
research. The difficulties and possible solutions we outline serve as
guidance for researchers hoping to make context-aware computing a reality.</p>
