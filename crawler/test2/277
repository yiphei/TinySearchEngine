<p><b>Abstract:</b> The ability to access information resources across organizational
boundaries is vital for today's corporate, military, and educational
organizations, which must be able to quickly pool their resources to respond
to opportunities and threats. Since each organization protects its resources
with its local authorization policies, we need mechanisms for cross-domain
authorization to achieve information sharing among multiple organizations.
Unfortunately, traditional identity-based authorization approaches are
impractical, because the identity of a requester is not a useful clue for
authorization in a decentralized environment. Many distributed authorization
schemes, therefore, consider a requester's properties (e.g., employer and
physical location) to make an authorization decision and use a logic-based
approach to specify authorization policies in a flexible way. Such a
distributed proof system makes an authorization decision by constructing a
proof with information provided by different entities in a distributed
environment. In this chapter, we provide an overview of distributed proof
systems for cross-domain authorization, while covering major language
constructs and proof-constructing algorithms, and introduce an emerging issue
of protecting confidential policies and credentials (facts) in a distributed
proof system involving multiple security domains since it is unlikely that a
principal in one security domain is willing to release all its local
information to any principal in other domains. We finally describe our
distributed proof system for cross-domain authorization in detail and show
how our cryptographic protocol allows mutually untrusted principals to
construct a proof in a decentralized way while preserving each principal's
security policies.</p>
