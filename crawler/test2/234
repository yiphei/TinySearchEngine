<b>Snowflake: A Worldwide Virtual Computer For Every User</b>.
January 
1997.
Unpublished manuscript.
<p><b>Abstract:</b> A system that allows users to access a distributed collection of
resources transparently, as if they were all part of a single computer
system, is said to have a single-system "image." The best current
single-system-image designs do not span administrative boundaries, and thus
still impose multiple system images on users who have accounts at sites in
several administrative domains. In this paper, we propose a system that
allows each computer user to aggregate resources from multiple sites into his
own single distributed virtual computer. Another difference between our
design and typical single-system-image cluster designs is that almost all of
the aggregation and abstraction functions in our design are implemented in
the user's environment, so the end user can replace and reconfigure them at
will.</p>
