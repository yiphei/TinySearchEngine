<b>A Multiprocessor Extension to the Conventional File System
Interface</b>.
Technical Report
PCS-TR94-230,
Dartmouth Computer Science,
September 
1994.
<p><b>Abstract:</b> As the I/O needs of parallel scientific applications increase,
file systems for multiprocessors are being designed to provide applications
with parallel access to multiple disks. Many parallel file systems present
applications with a conventional Unix-like interface that allows the
application to access multiple disks transparently. By tracing all the
activity of a parallel file system in a production, scientific computing
environment, we show that many applications exhibit highly regular, but
non-consecutive I/O access patterns. Since the conventional interface does
not provide an efficient method of describing these patterns, we present an
extension which supports  strided and  nested-strided I/O
requests.</p>
