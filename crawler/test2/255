<b>Performance Evaluation of a Resource Discovery Service</b>.

<p><b>Abstract:</b> In a pervasive computing environment, the number and variety of
resources (services, devices, and contextual information resources) make it
necessary for applications to accurately discover the best ones quickly. Thus
a resource-discovery service, which locates specific resources and
establishes network connections as better resources become available, is
necessary for those applications. The performance of the resource-discovery
service is important when the applications are in a dynamic and mobile
environment. In this thesis, however, we do not focus on the resource-
discovery technology itself, but the evaluation of the scalability and
mobility of the resource discovery module in Solar, a context fusion
middleware. Solar has a naming service that provides resource discovery,
since the resource names encode static and dynamic attributes. The results of
our experiments show that Solar's resource discovery performed generally well
in a typical dynamic environment, although Solar can not be scaled as well as
it should. And we identify the implementation issues related to that problem.
We also discuss experience, insights, and lessons learned from our
quantitative analysis of the experiment results.</p>
