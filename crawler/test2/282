<p><b>Abstract:</b> Opportunistic sensing allows applications to ``task'' mobile
devices to measure context in a target region. For example, one could
leverage sensor-equipped vehicles to measure traffic or pollution levels on a
particular street, or users' mobile phones to locate (Bluetooth-enabled)
objects in their neighborhood. In most proposed applications, context reports
include the time and location of the event, putting the privacy of users at
increased risk--even if a report has been anonymized, the accompanying time
and location can reveal sufficient information to deanonymize the user whose
device sent the report. <P> We propose AnonySense, a general-purpose
architecture for leveraging users' mobile devices for measuring context,
while maintaining the privacy of the users. AnonySense features multiple
layers of privacy protection--a framework for nodes to receive tasks
anonymously, a novel blurring mechanism based on tessellation and clustering
to protect users' privacy against the system while reporting context, and
$k$-anonymous report aggregation to improve the users' privacy against
applications receiving the context. We outline the architecture and security
properties of AnonySense, and focus on evaluating our tessellation and
clustering algorithm against real mobility traces.</p>
