<h1>STARFISH: Simulation Tool for Advanced Research in File Systems</H1>

 Version 3.0,  October 1996<BR>
</H3>

<hr>

<P> STARFISH is a simulator for experimenting with concepts in
parallel file systems.  It is based on Eric Brewer's <EM>Proteus</EM>
simulator from MIT, version 3.01, and <b>runs only on (MIPS-based)
DECstations</b>.  I have used this simulator in experiments for
several research <A HREF="papers/">papers</A> about
<EM>disk-directed I/O</EM>. </P>

<H3>Warning: </H3> 
 <P> <EM> I am providing the code as-is, with little cleanup or added
documentation.  Some of the code is out-of-date and may have bugs.
Other parts are incomplete.  Many of the analysis scripts are fragile.
The code is constantly evolving, and new public releases may be rare.
But many people have asked me for it, so here it is.</EM></P>

See other warnings in the src/README file.<p>

It's probably not as bad as it sounds ;-).<p>

<H3>Usage rules:</H3>
 <P> You're welcome to look at the code and even try to run it, but I
really don't have time to help you out much.  If you publish any
results based on this simulator, please cite me and provide the URL
for this page.</P>

<H3>Copying rules: </H3>
 <P> This package may be freely copied as long as it is kept intact
with my name on it.  You may not sell it for commercial purposes (hah!
as if anyone would pay for it.)  Please send me a note if you have a
copy of this code, so I can keep track of how many copies there are,
send you email about new versions, and so forth.  Please ask me before
you distribute any modified version.</P>

<H3> What you can get:</H3>

<A HREF="starfish3.0.tar.gz"> Sources</A> 
 (2.1 MB, 9.4 MB uncompressed):
   <UL>
   <LI>	starfish/proteus (the Proteus simulator and tools, with my changes)
   <LI>	starfish/src (the source code, and compilation director)
   <LI>	starfish/src/run (the scripts necessary to build and run my experiments)
   </UL>

<H3> The name:</H3>
 <P>The name STARFISH is an acronym, but it fits with the maritime
theme of the Proteus simulator on which it is based (Proteus was a
Greek god of the sea).</P>
