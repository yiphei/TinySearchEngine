<b>Experimental evaluation of wireless simulation assumptions</b>.
Technical Report
TR2004-507,
Dartmouth Computer Science,
June 
2004.
<p><b>Abstract:</b> All analytical and simulation research on ad&nbsp;hoc wireless
networks must necessarily model radio propagation using simplifying
assumptions. Although it is tempting to assume that all radios have circular
range, have perfect coverage in that range, and travel on a two-dimensional
plane, most researchers are increasingly aware of the need to represent more
realistic features, including hills, obstacles, link asymmetries, and
unpredictable fading. Although many have noted the complexity of real radio
propagation, and some have quantified the effect of overly simple assumptions
on the simulation of ad&nbsp;hoc network protocols, we provide a comprehensive
review of six assumptions that are still part of many ad&nbsp;hoc network
simulation studies. In particular, we use an extensive set of measurements
from a large outdoor routing experiment to demonstrate the weakness of these
assumptions, and show how these assumptions cause simulation results to
differ significantly from experimental results. We close with a series of
recommendations for researchers, whether they develop protocols, analytic
models, or simulators for ad&nbsp;hoc wireless networks.</p>
