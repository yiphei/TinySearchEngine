<p><b>Abstract:</b> Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs) are now commonplace on many
academic and corporate campuses. As ``Wi-Fi'' technology becomes ubiquitous,
it is increasingly important to understand trends in the usage of these
networks. <P> This paper analyzes an extensive network trace from a mature
802.11 WLAN, including more than 550 access points and 7000 users over
seventeen weeks. We employ several measurement techniques, including syslogs,
telephone records, SNMP polling and tcpdump packet sniffing. This is the
largest WLAN study to date, and the first to look at a large, mature WLAN and
consider geographic mobility. We compare this trace to a trace taken after
the network's initial deployment two years ago. <P> We found that the
applications used on the WLAN changed dramatically. Initial WLAN usage was
dominated by Web traffic; our new trace shows significant increases in
peer-to-peer, streaming multimedia, and voice over IP (VoIP) traffic.
On-campus traffic now exceeds off-campus traffic, a reversal of the situation
at the WLAN's initial deployment. Our study indicates that VoIP has been used
little on the wireless network thus far, and most VoIP calls are made on the
wired network. Most calls last less than a minute. <P> We saw greater
heterogeneity in the types of clients used, with more embedded wireless
devices such as PDAs and mobile VoIP clients. We define a new metric for
mobility, the ``session diameter.'' We use this metric to show that embedded
devices have different mobility characteristics than laptops, and travel
further and roam to more access points. Overall, users were surprisingly
non-mobile, with half remaining close to home about 9837666460f the time.</p>
