<b>Wearable computing device for secure control of physiological
sensors and medical devices, with secure storage of medical records, and
bioimpedance biometric</b>.
U.S. Patent 9,595,187,
March 
2017.
<p><b>Abstract:</b> A wearable master electronic device (Amulet) has a processor with
memory, the processor coupled to a body-area network (BAN) radio and uplink
radio. The device has firmware for BAN communications with wearable nodes to
receive data, and in an embodiment, send configuration data. The device has
firmware for using the uplink radio to download apps and configurations, and
upload data to a server. An embodiment has accelerometers in Amulet and
wearable node, and firmware for using accelerometer readings to determine if
node and Amulet are worn by the same subject. Other embodiments use pulse
sensors or microphones in the Amulet and node to both identify a subject and
verify the Amulet and node are worn by the same subject. Another embodiment
uses a bioimpedance sensor to identify the subject. The wearable node may be
an insulin pump, chemotherapy pump, TENS unit, cardiac monitor, or other
device.</p>
