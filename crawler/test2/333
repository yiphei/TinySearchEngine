<b>Wanda: securely introducing mobile devices - Extended version</b>.
Technical Report
TR2016-789,
Dartmouth Computer Science,
February 
2016.
Expanded version of the INFOCOM 2016 paper by the same title.
<p><b>Abstract:</b> Nearly every setting is increasingly populated with wireless and
mobile devices - whether appliances in a home, medical devices in a health
clinic, sensors in an industrial setting, or devices in an office or school.
There are three fundamental operations when bringing a new device into any of
these settings: (1) to configure the device to join the wireless local-area
network, (2) to partner the device with other nearby devices so they can work
together, and (3) to configure the device so it connects to the relevant
individual or organizational account in the cloud. The challenge is to
accomplish all three goals simply, securely, and consistent with user intent.
We present a novel approach we call Wanda - a 'magic wand' that accomplishes
all three of the above goals - and evaluate a prototype implementation. This
Tech Report contains supplemental information to our INFOCOM 2016 paper
titled, "Wanda: securely introducing mobile devices." Much of the additional
information is in Section II, III, and VI.</p>
