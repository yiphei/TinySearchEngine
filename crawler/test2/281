<p><b>Abstract:</b> As sensor technology becomes increasingly easy to integrate into
personal devices such as mobile phones, clothing, and athletic equipment,
there will be new applications involving opportunistic, people-centric
sensing. These applications, which gather information about human activities
and personal social context, raise many security and privacy challenges. In
particular, data integrity is important for many applications, whether using
traffic data for city planning or medical data for diagnosis. Although our
AnonySense system (presented at MobiSys) addresses privacy in people-centric
sensing, protecting data integrity in people-centric sensing still remains a
challenge. Some mechanisms to protect privacy provide anonymity, and thus
provide limited means for accountability; data integrity becomes even more
difficult to protect. <P> We propose SenseRight, the first architecture for
high-integrity people-centric sensing. The SenseRight approach, which extends
and enhances AnonySense, assures integrity of both the sensor data (through
use of tamper-resistant sensor devices) and the sensor context (through a
time-constrained protocol), maintaining anonymity if desired.</p>
