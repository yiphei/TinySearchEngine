<p><b>Abstract:</b> Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs) are now commonplace on many
academic and corporate campuses. As "Wi-Fi" technology becomes ubiquitous, it
is increasingly important to understand trends in the usage of these
networks. This paper analyzes an extensive network trace from a mature 802.11
WLAN, including more than 550 access points and 7000 users over seventeen
weeks. We employ several measurement techniques, including syslog messages,
telephone records, SNMP polling and tcpdump packet captures. This is the
largest WLAN study to date, and the first to look at a mature WLAN. We
compare this trace to a trace taken after the network's initial deployment
two years prior. <P> We found that the applications used on the WLAN changed
dramatically, with significant increases in peer-to-peer and streaming
multimedia traffic. Despite the introduction of a Voice over IP (VoIP) system
that includes wireless handsets, our study indicates that VoIP has been used
little on the wireless network thus far, and most VoIP calls are made on the
wired network. <P> We saw greater heterogeneity in the types of clients
used, with more embedded wireless devices such as PDAs and mobile VoIP
clients. We define a new metric for mobility, the "session diameter". We use
this metric to show that embedded devices have different mobility
characteristics than laptops, and travel further and roam to more access
points. Overall, users were surprisingly non-mobile, with half remaining
close to home about 9837666460f the time.</p>
