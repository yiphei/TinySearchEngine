<p><b>Abstract:</b> This paper presents Mobile Voice Over IP, an application-level
protocol to support terminal mobility in real-time applications such as voice
over IP, on a wireless local area network. We describe our MVOIP
implementation based on the ITU-T H.323 protocol stack, present experimental
results on call hand-off latency, and discuss various implementation issues,
including the task of quickly and accurately determining when call hand-off
is necessary. We also discuss how MVOIP relates to other proposed mobility
support schemes, and how it can be generalized to provide application-level
mobility support in a wide range of real and non real-time applications.</p>
