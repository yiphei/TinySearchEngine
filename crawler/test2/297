<b>Exposing privacy concerns in mHealth</b>.
In
<i>USENIX Workshop on Health Security (HealthSec)</i>,
August 
2011.
Position paper.
<p><b>Abstract:</b> We conducted several exploratory focus groups to understand what
privacy concerns Patients might have with the collection, storage and sharing
of their personal health information, when using mHealth devices. We found
that Patients want control over their health information, and we noticed
privacy trends that were particular to Patients in the same age group and
with similar health experiences.</p>
