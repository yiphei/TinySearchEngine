<p><b>Abstract:</b> We propose a simple active method for discovering facts about the
chipset, the firmware or the driver of an 802.11 wireless device by observing
its responses (or lack thereof) to a series of crafted non-standard or
malformed 802.11 frames. We demonstrate that such responses can differ
significantly enough to distinguish between a number of popular chipsets and
drivers. We expect to significantly expand the number of recognized device
types through community contributions of signature data for the proposed open
fingerprinting framework. Our method complements known fingerprinting
approaches, and can be used to interrogate and spot devices that may be
spoofing their MAC addresses in order to conceal their true architecture from
other stations, such as a fake AP seeking to engage clients in complex
protocol frame exchange (e.g., in order to exploit a driver vulnerability).
In particular, it can be used to distinguish rogue APs from legitimate APs
before association.</p>
