<p><b>Abstract:</b> Many scientific applications that run on today's multiprocessors,
such as weather forecasting and seismic analysis, are bottlenecked by their
file-I/O needs. Even if the multiprocessor is configured with sufficient I/O
hardware, the file-system software often fails to provide the available
bandwidth to the application. Although libraries and enhanced file-system
interfaces can make a significant improvement, we believe that fundamental
changes are needed in the file-server software. We propose a new technique,
disk-directed I/O, to allow the disk servers to determine the flow of data
for maximum performance. Our simulations show that tremendous performance
gains are possible both for simple reads and writes and for an out-of-core
application. Indeed, our disk-directed I/O technique provided consistent high
performance that was largely independent of data distribution, obtained up to
9337670500f peak disk bandwidth, and was as much as 18 times faster than the
traditional technique.</p>
