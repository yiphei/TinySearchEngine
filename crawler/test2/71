<b>Disk-directed I/O for an Out-of-core Computation</b>.
Technical Report
PCS-TR95-251,
Dartmouth Computer Science,
January 
1995.
<p><b>Abstract:</b> New file systems are critical to obtain good I/O performance on
large multiprocessors. Several researchers have suggested the use of 
collective file-system operations, in which all processes in an
application cooperate in each I/O request. Others have suggested that the
traditional low-level interface (\tt read, write, seek) be augmented with
various higher-level requests (e.g.,  read matrix), allowing the
programmer to express a complex transfer in a single (perhaps collective)
request. Collective, high-level requests permit techniques like 
two-phase I/O and  disk-directed I/O to significantly improve
performance over traditional file systems and interfaces. Neither of these
techniques have been tested on anything other than simple benchmarks that
read or write matrices. Many applications, however, intersperse computation
and I/O to work with data sets that cannot fit in main memory. In this paper,
we present the results of experiments with an ``out-of-core''
LU-decomposition program, comparing a traditional interface and file system
with a system that has a high-level, collective interface and disk-directed
I/O. We found that a collective interface was awkward in some places, and
forced additional synchronization. Nonetheless, disk-directed I/O was able to
obtain much better performance than the traditional system.</p>
