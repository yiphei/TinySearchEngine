<p><b>Abstract:</b> Wearables are small and have limited user interfaces, so they
often wirelessly interface with a personal smartphone/computer to relay
information from the wearable for display or other interactions. In this
paper, we envision a new method, LightTouch, by which a wearable can
establish a secure connection to an ambient display, such as a television or
a computer monitor, while ensuring the user's intention to connect to the
display. LightTouch uses standard RF methods (like Bluetooth) for
communicating the data to display, securely bootstrapped via the
visible-light communication (the brightness channel) from the display to the
low-cost, low-power, ambient light sensor of a wearable. A screen `touch'
gesture is adopted by users to ensure that the modulation of screen
brightness can be securely captured by the ambient light sensor with
minimized noise. Wireless coordination with the processor driving the display
establishes a shared secret based on the brightness channel information. We
further propose novel on-screen localization and correlation algorithms to
improve security and reliability. Through experiments and a preliminary user
study we demonstrate that LightTouch is compatible with current display and
wearable designs, is easy to use (about 6 seconds to connect), is reliable
