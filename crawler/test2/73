<b>Interfaces for Disk-Directed I/O</b>.
Technical Report
PCS-TR95-270,
Dartmouth Computer Science,
September 
1995.
<p><b>Abstract:</b> In other papers I propose the idea of disk-directed I/O for
multiprocessor file systems. Those papers focus on the performance advantages
and capabilities of disk-directed I/O, but say little about the
application-programmer's interface or about the interface between the compute
processors and I/O processors. In this short note I discuss the requirements
for these interfaces, and look at many existing interfaces for parallel file
systems. I conclude that many of the existing interfaces could be adapted for
use in a disk-directed I/O system.</p>
<p><b>Keywords:</b> parallel-IO, parallel computing, file system</p>
