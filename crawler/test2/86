<b>File-Access Characteristics of Parallel Scientific Workloads</b>.
Technical Report
PCS-TR95-263,
Dartmouth Computer Science,
August 
1995.
<p><b>Abstract:</b> Phenomenal improvements in the computational performance of
multiprocessors have not been matched by comparable gains in I/O system
performance. This imbalance has resulted in I/O becoming a significant
bottleneck for many scientific applications. One key to overcoming this
bottleneck is improving the performance of parallel file systems. <P> The
design of a high-performance parallel file system requires a comprehensive
understanding of the expected workload. Unfortunately, until recently, no
general workload studies of parallel file systems have been conducted. The
goal of the CHARISMA project was to remedy this problem by characterizing the
behavior of several production workloads, on different machines, at the level
of individual reads and writes. The first set of results from the CHARISMA
project describe the workloads observed on an Intel iPSC/860 and a Thinking
Machines CM-5. This paper is intended to compare and contrast these two
workloads for an understanding of their essential similarities and
differences, isolating common trends and platform-dependent variances. Using
this comparison, we are able to gain more insight into the general principles
that should guide parallel file-system design.</p>
