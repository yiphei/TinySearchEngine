<b>Securely Connecting Wearable Health Devices to External Displays</b>.

<p><b>Abstract:</b> Wearable health technology is becoming a hot commodity as it has
the potential to help both patients and clinicians continuously monitor vital
signs and symptoms. One popular type of wearable devices are worn on human
wrist and are equipped with sensors to passively perform sensing tasks. Their
constrained user interface, however, is ineffective to display the sensory
data for users. We envision connecting a wrist-worn device to a display
device, such as a television, so the user is able to view the sensory data.
Such connections must be secure to prevent the sensory data from being
eavesdropped by other devices, must be made only when the user intends, and
must be easy even when a new display is encountered (such as in a medical
clinic, or a hotel room). In this presentation, we will discuss the secure
wearable/display connection problem by revisiting existing methods and
hardware designs of wrist-worn devices and display devices. We then present
possible solutions that leverage the built-in hardware components of
wrist-worn devices to implement, secure, intentional, easy connections to
ambient display devices.</p>
