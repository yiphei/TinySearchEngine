<p>
 I am <b>not</b> currently seeking a postdoc to join 
<a href="people.html">my team</a> as a postdoc.
</p>

<p>
The postdoc will be involved in our research on security &amp; privacy for
healthcare information systems; in particular, my group is working on
secure methods for use of mobile computing and wearable sensors in the
context of healthcare (mHealth).
See our <a href="http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~dfk/papers/index.html#mhealth">recent papers</a>.
As such, the postdoc would join an inter-disciplinary team
working on multiple funded projects, primarily 
the <a href=http://amulet-project.org>Amulet</a> 
and <a href="http://thaw.org">THaW</a> projects.
We collaborate with colleagues in the engineering and medical schools,
and at other universities (Clemson, Johns Hopkins, U.Illinois, U.Michigan).
</p>

<p>
The candidate must have finished his or her Ph.D in Computer Science
or Computer Engineering, have deep experience with mobile/ubiquitous
computing, security, or privacy, have experience planning and
conducting experimental computer systems research, and be an
excellent programmer. Ideal candidates will also have experience with
embedded computing, sensor networks, machine learning, Android
programming, student mentoring, or project management.
