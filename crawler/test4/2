<h1>Visiting Dartmouth Computer Science</h1>

Welcome to Dartmouth!  So pleased you will be visiting the <a href="http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu">Department of Computer Science</a>, which is <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Dartmouth+College:+Sudikoff+Lab/@43.7068466,-72.2892476,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x4cb4c9c4a19d0989:0xc99a2845d4ab57ff!8m2!3d43.7068466!4d-72.2870536">located</a> in the Sudikoff building on Maynard Street.
See the <a href="http://dartmouth.edu/dartmouth-maps">campus map</a>,
and information about <a href="#parking">parking</a> below.
<p>

You can reach the department's main office at <b>+1&nbsp;603-646-2206</b> during normal business hours.

<h2 id=travel>Traveling to Hanover</h2>

<h3 id=air>By air</h3>
There are several options, and the best choice depends on connectivity to your origin and your personal preferences.
<p>

<lu>
 <li> <b>Boston, MA (BOS)</b> is the furthest away (2.5-hour drive) but has the most connectivity, especially overseas.
Despite its distance it is often the most convenient because you can take the <a href="http://dartmouthcoach.com">Dartmouth Coach</a> door-to-door from the airport to the center of campus, right next to the Hanover Inn, two blocks from the Six South Street Hotel, and two blocks from Sudikoff.  
The Coach is very comfortable, <a href="http://dartmouthcoach.com/route/upper-valley-to-boston-logan-airport/">runs</a> every two hours, is very reliable, and has in-seat power and on-board Wi-Fi.
<p>

 <li> <b>Manchester, NH (MHT)</b> is an easy drive (75 minutes, all interstate) with service from major airlines including American, Delta, Southwest, and United.
You'll likely need to rent a car, but <a href="http://www.uvride.com">UVRide</a> can also be an option.
<p>

 <li> <b>Burlington, VT (BTV)</b> is an easy drive (90 minutes, all interstate) with service from major airlines including American, Delta, JetBlue, and United.  
A bit smaller than Manchester with fewer flights.
You'll need to rent a car.
<p>

 <li> <b>Lebanon, NH (LEB)</b> is the closest (15-minute drive and cab service is available) but with very small planes and very few flights.
<a href="">Cape Air</a> offers <a href="https://www.capeair.com/where_we_fly/New_England/Vermont_New_Hampshire.html">scheduled flights</a> to and from Boston's Logan Airport and Westchester County Airport in White Plains, NY; for the latter they offer van connections to downtown New York City. 
This is the fastest way to reach Hanover from New York, and (with the right connections in Boston) the fastest route to and from Washington, DC. 
That said, these small planes are more susceptible to winter-weather cancellation and, with so few flights daily, there are few alternatives to a cancelled flight. 

<h3 id=car>By car</h3>
From Manchester or the Boston region, take I-93 to I-89 and get off onto Route 120 (Exit 18); turn right and follow it into Hanover.  
From New York or points south, take I-91 north to the Norwich/Hanover exit (Exit 13); turn right and follow it into Hanover.  
Sudikoff is on Maynard Street [<a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Dartmouth+College:+Sudikoff+Lab/@43.7068466,-72.2892476,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x4cb4c9c4a19d0989:0xc99a2845d4ab57ff!8m2!3d43.7068466!4d-72.2870536">google map</a>], which is only one-block long so it is easy to find. 
See also the <a href="http://dartmouth.edu/dartmouth-maps">campus map</a>.

<h2 id=parking>Parking</h2>

There are a few metered spots along Maynard street (2-hour limit, 9am-5pm Monday through Saturday).

The <a href="http://dartmouth.edu/dartmouth-maps">campus map</a> shows the location of College-managed parking lots.  
The most convenient lot is across the street, on the north side of Maynard Street.  
If that is full, you may need to park in the Dewey Field lot (one block north of Maynard Street; turn left at the traffic light and then curve right so you park close to the traffic light so you can walk back up past the light and south to Sudikoff.)

If you park in any College lot please stop at the front desk in Sudikoff and ask the staff to call Parking Services so they will note you as a visitor; they'll ask for your car's make, model, color, and plate number.
