<b>Write Once, Move Anywhere: Toward Dynamic Interoperability of Mobile
Agent Systems</b>.
Technical Report

Dartmouth Computer Science,
July 
2001.
<p><b>Abstract:</b> Mobile agents are an increasingly popular paradigm, and in recent
years there has been a proliferation of mobile-agent systems. These systems
are, however, largely incompatible with each other. In particular, agents
cannot migrate to a host that runs a different mobile-agent system. Prior
approaches to interoperability have tried to force agents to use a common
API, and so far none have succeeded. Our goal, summarized in the catch phrase
``Write Once, Move Anywhere,'' led to our efforts to develop mechanisms that
support dynamic runtime interoperability of mobile-agent systems. This paper
describes the Grid Mobile-Agent System, which allows agents to migrate to
different mobile-agent systems.</p>
