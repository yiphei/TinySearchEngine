<p><b>Abstract:</b> Nearly every setting is increasingly populated with wireless and
mobile devices - whether appliances in a home, medical devices in a health
clinic, sensors in an industrial setting, or devices in an office or school.
There are three fundamental operations when bringing a new device into any of
these settings: (1) to configure the device to join the wireless local-area
network, (2) to partner the device with other nearby devices so they can work
together, and (3) to configure the device so it connects to the relevant
individual or organizational account in the cloud. The challenge is to
accomplish all three goals simply, securely, and consistent with user
intent. We present a novel approach we call Wanda - a `magic wand' that
accomplishes all three of the above goals - and evaluate a prototype
implementation.</p>
