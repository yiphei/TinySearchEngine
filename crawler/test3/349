<p><b>Abstract:</b> We are developing wearable devices as the foundation for a
consistently present and highly available body-area mHealth network. Our
vision is that a small device, such as a bracelet or pendant, will provide
the availability and reliability properties essential for successful
body-area mHealth networks. We call this class of device computational
jewelry, and expect it will be the next frontier of mobile systems. We
prototyped our first piece of computational jewelry, which we call Amulet, to
enable our previously proposed vision. It runs applications that may collect
sensor data from built-in sensors or from other devices, analyze and log the
data, queue information for later upload, and interact with the wearer.
Independent developers can develop applications that can be vetted and
installed on an Amulet.</p>
