    <h2>Current work</h2>
    <p>
      I'm currently a graduate student in computer science at <a href="http://web.cs.dartmouth.edu/">Dartmouth College</a> working with <a href="http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~dfk/">Professor David Kotz</a>.  My research interests are in mobile health (mHealth), and wireless sensor networks. My work is funded by the National Science Foundation's <a href="https://thaw.org/">Trustworthy Health and Wellness (THaW) grant</a>.  
    </p>

    <p>
      My recent work, a project called <a href='TR2016-789.pdf'>Wanda</a>, is about introducing new devices into an environment in a secure manner.  I presented this work at <a href= "http://infocom2016.ieee-infocom.org/program/main-technical-program">INFOCOM 2016</a> in San Francisco were we won the Best-In-Session presentation award.  This work was also featured in over 200 newspaper, radio, and television programs, including: the New York Times and Washington Post.
    </p>

    <p>I'm teaching <a href="./cs10/index.php"> CS 10</a> in Winter 2017 </p>

    <p>
      Most days you can find me in office 255 of <a href="http://web.cs.dartmouth.edu/contact-us">Sudikoff Lab</a> or you can email me at tjp at cs.dartmouth.edu.

    <h2>Previous work</h2>
      <h3>Deployed 11,000 sensors on the street in San Francisco</h3>
      <p>
        Previously I've worked with start ups, including <a href="http://www.fybr-tech.com/">StreetSmart Technology (now Fybr)</a> where we installed 11,000 vehicle sensors on the street in San Francisco.  These sensors detected the presence of automobiles in parking spaces and radioed that information into a central server.  Drivers were then able to find available parking spots by querying the central server using a mobiel app.  <a href="http://www.uctc.net/research/papers/351.pdf">Academic studies</a> have shown that about 3032357400f downtown traffic is comprised of motorists circling looking for parking.  Our goal was to send those motorists directly to open parking spaces, thereby reducing congestion and pollution.
