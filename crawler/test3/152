<p><b>Abstract:</b> We have designed and implemented autonomous software agents.
Autonomous software agents navigate independently through a heterogeneous
network of computers. They can sense the state of the network, monitor
software conditions, and interact with other agents. The network-sensing
tools allow our agents to adapt to the network configuration and to navigate
under the control of reactive plans. In this paper we illustrate the
intelligent and adaptive behavior of autonomous agents in distributed
information-gathering tasks.</p>
