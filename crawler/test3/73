<p><b>Abstract:</b> The computational performance of multiprocessors continues to
improve by leaps and bounds, fueled in part by rapid improvements in
processor and interconnection technology. I/O performance thus becomes ever
more critical, to avoid becoming the bottleneck of system performance. In
this paper we provide an introduction to I/O architectural issues in
multiprocessors, with a focus on disk subsystems. While we discuss examples
from actual architectures and provide pointers to interesting research in the
literature, we do not attempt to provide a comprehensive survey. We
concentrate on a study of the architectural design issues, and the effects of
different design alternatives.</p>
