<p><b>Abstract:</b> Phenomenal improvements in the computational performance of
multiprocessors have not been matched by comparable gains in I/O system
performance. This imbalance has resulted in I/O becoming a significant
bottleneck for many scientific applications. One key to overcoming this
bottleneck is improving the performance of multiprocessor file systems. <P>
The design of a high-performance multiprocessor file system requires a
comprehensive understanding of the expected workload. Unfortunately, until
recently, no general workload studies of multiprocessor file systems have
been conducted. The goal of the CHARISMA project was to remedy this problem
by characterizing the behavior of several production workloads, on different
machines, at the level of individual reads and writes. The first set of
results from the CHARISMA project describe the workloads observed on an Intel
iPSC/860 and a Thinking Machines CM-5. This paper is intended to compare and
contrast these two workloads for an understanding of their essential
similarities and differences, isolating common trends and platform-dependent
variances. Using this comparison, we are able to gain more insight into the
general principles that should guide multiprocessor file-system design.</p>
