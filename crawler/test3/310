<p><b>Abstract:</b> In people-centric opportunistic sensing, people offer their
mobile nodes (such as smart phones) as platforms for collecting sensor data.
A sensing application distributes sensing `tasks,' which specify what sensor
data to collect and under what conditions to report the data back to the
application. To perform a task, mobile nodes may use on-board sensors, a
body-area network of personal sensors, or sensors from neighboring nodes that
volunteer to contribute their sensing resources. In all three cases,
continuous sensor monitoring can drain a node's battery. <P> We propose
DEAMON (Distributed Energy-Aware MONitoring), an energy-efficient distributed
algorithm for long-term sensor monitoring. Our approach assumes only that
mobile nodes are tasked to report sensor data under conditions specified by a
Boolean expression, and that a network of nearby sensor nodes contribute to
monitoring subsets of the task's sensors. Our algorithm to select sensor
nodes and to monitor the sensing condition conserves energy of all nodes by
limiting sensing and communication operations. We evaluate DEAMON with a
stochastic analysis and with simulation results, and show that it should
significantly reduce energy consumption.</p>
