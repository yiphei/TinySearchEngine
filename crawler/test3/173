<b>Mobile-Agent versus Client/Server Performance: Scalability in an
Information-Retrieval Task</b>.
Technical Report
TR2001-386,
Dartmouth Computer Science,
January 
2001.
<p><b>Abstract:</b> Mobile agents are programs that can jump from host to host in the
network, at times and to places of their own choosing. Many groups have
developed mobile-agent software platforms, and several mobile-agent
applications. Experiments show that mobile agents can, among other things,
lead to faster applications, reduced bandwidth demands, or less dependence on
a reliable network connection. There are few if any studies of the
scalability of mobile-agent servers, particularly as the number of clients
grows. We present some recent performance and scalability experiments that
compare three mobile-agent platforms with each other and with a traditional
client/server approach. The experiments show that mobile agents often
outperform client/server solutions, but also demonstrate the deep interaction
between environmental and application parameters. The three mobile-agent
platforms have similar behavior but their absolute performance varies with
underlying implementation choices.</p>
