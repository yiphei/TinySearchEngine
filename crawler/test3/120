<b>Low-level Interfaces for High-level Parallel I/O</b>.
In
<i>Proceedings of the IPPS&nbsp;'95 Workshop on Input/Output in Parallel
and Distributed Systems (IOPADS)</i>,
pages 47-62,
April 
1995.
<p><b>Abstract:</b> As the I/O needs of parallel scientific applications increase,
file systems for multiprocessors are being designed to provide applications
with parallel access to multiple disks. Many parallel file systems present
applications with a conventional Unix-like interface that allows the
application to access multiple disks transparently. By tracing all the
activity of a parallel file system in a production, scientific computing
environment, we show that many applications exhibit highly regular, but
non-consecutive I/O access patterns. Since the conventional interface does
not provide an efficient method of describing these patterns, we present
three extensions to the interface that support  strided, 
nested-strided, and  nested-batched I/O requests. We show how these
extensions can be used to express common access patterns.</p>
