<p><b>Abstract:</b> We consider the simplest IEEE&nbsp;802.11 WLAN networks for which
analytical models are available and seek to provide an experimental
validation of these models. Our experiments include the following cases:
(i)&nbsp;two nodes with saturated queues, sending fixed-length UDP packets to each
other, and (ii)&nbsp;a TCP-controlled transfer between two nodes. Our experiments
are based entirely on Aruba AP-70 access points operating under Linux.
We report our observations on certain non-standard behavior of the devices.
In cases where the devices adhere to the standards, we find that the results
from the analytical models estimate the experimental data with a mean error
of 3-5%.0</p>
