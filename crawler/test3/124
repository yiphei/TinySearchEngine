<b>The Galley Parallel File System</b>.
Technical Report
PCS-TR96-286,
Dartmouth Computer Science,
May 
1996.
<p><b>Abstract:</b> Most current multiprocessor file systems are designed to use
multiple disks in parallel, using the high aggregate bandwidth to meet the
growing I/O requirements of parallel scientific applications. Many
multiprocessor file systems provide applications with a conventional
Unix-like interface, allowing the application to access multiple disks
transparently. This interface conceals the parallelism within the file
system, increasing the ease of programmability, but making it difficult or
impossible for sophisticated programmers and libraries to use knowledge about
their I/O needs to exploit that parallelism. In addition to providing an
insufficient interface, most current multiprocessor file systems are
optimized for a different workload than they are being asked to support. We
introduce Galley, a new parallel file system that is intended to efficiently
support realistic scientific multiprocessor workloads. We discuss Galley's
file structure and application interface, as well as the performance
advantages offered by that interface.</p>
