<p><b>Abstract:</b> We consider the problem of intrusion analysis and present the
Kerf toolkit, whose purpose is to provide an efficient and flexible
infrastructure for the analysis of attacks. The Kerf toolkit includes a
mechanism for securely recording host and network logging information for a
network of workstations, a domain-specific language for querying this stored
data, and an interface for viewing the results of such a query, providing
feedback on these results, and generating new queries in an iterative
fashion. We describe the architecture of Kerf in detail, present examples to
demonstrate the power of our query language, and discuss the performance of
our implementation of this system.</p>
