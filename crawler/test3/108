<p><b>Abstract:</b> Multiprocessors have permitted astounding increases in
computational performance, but many cannot meet the intense I/O requirements
of some scientific applications. An important component of any solution to
this I/O bottleneck is a parallel file system that can provide high-bandwidth
access to tremendous amounts of data  in parallel to hundreds or
thousands of processors. <P> Most successful systems are based on a solid
understanding of the characteristics of the expected workload, but until now
there have been no comprehensive workload characterizations of multiprocessor
file systems. We began the CHARISMA project in an attempt to fill that gap.
We instrumented the common node library on the iPSC/860 at NASA Ames to
record all file-related activity over a two-week period. Our instrumentation
is different from previous efforts in that it collects information about
every read and write request and about the  mix of jobs running in the
machine (rather than from selected applications). <P> The trace analysis in
this paper leads to many recommendations for designers of multiprocessor file
systems. First, the file system should support simultaneous access to many
different files by many jobs. Second, it should expect to see many small
requests, predominantly sequential and regular access patterns (although of a
different form than in uniprocessors), little or no concurrent file-sharing
between jobs, significant byte- and block-sharing between processes within
jobs, and strong interprocess locality. Third, our trace-driven simulations
showed that these characteristics led to great success in caching, both at
the compute nodes and at the I/O&nbsp;nodes. Finally, we recommend supporting
strided I/O requests in the file-system interface, to reduce overhead and
allow more performance optimization by the file system.</p>
