<b>Applications of Parallel I/O</b>.
Technical Report
PCS-TR96-297,
Dartmouth Computer Science,
October 
1996.
Release 1.
<p><b>Abstract:</b> Scientific applications are increasingly being implemented on
massively parallel supercomputers. Many of these applications have intense
I/O demands, as well as massive computational requirements. This paper is
essentially an annotated bibliography of papers and other sources of
information about scientific applications using parallel I/O. It will be
updated periodically.</p>
<p><b>Keywords:</b> parallel-IO, file system, parallel computing</p>
