<p><b>Abstract:</b> In traditional computational systems, resource owners have no
incentive to subject themselves to additional risk and congestion associated
with providing service to arbitrary agents, but there are applications that
benefit from open environments. We argue for the use of markets to regulate
agent systems. With market mechanisms, agents have the abilities to assess
the cost of their actions, behave responsibly, and coordinate their resource
usage both temporally and spatially. <P> We discuss our market structure and
mechanisms we have developed to foster secure exchange between agents and
hosts. Additionally, we believe that certain agent applications encourage
repeated interactions that benefit both agents and hosts, giving further
reason for hosts to fairly accommodate agents. We apply our ideas to create a
resource-allocation policy for mobile-agent systems, from which we derive an
algorithm for a mobile agent to plan its expenditure and travel. With perfect
information, the algorithm guarantees the agent's optimal completion time.
<P> We relax the assumptions underlying our algorithm design and simulate
our planning algorithm and allocation policy to show that the policy
prioritizes agents by endowment, handles bursty workloads, adapts to
situations where network resources are overextended, and that delaying
agents' actions does not catastrophically affect agents' performance.</p>
