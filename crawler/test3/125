<p><b>Abstract:</b> As the I/O needs of parallel scientific applications increase,
file systems for multiprocessors are being designed to provide applications
with parallel access to multiple disks. Many parallel file systems present
applications with a conventional Unix-like interface that allows the
application to access multiple disks transparently. This interface conceals
the parallelism within the file system, which increases the ease of
programmability, but makes it difficult or impossible for sophisticated
programmers and libraries to use knowledge about their I/O needs to exploit
that parallelism. Furthermore, most current parallel file systems are
optimized for a different workload than they are being asked to support. We
introduce Galley, a new parallel file system that is intended to efficiently
support realistic parallel workloads. Initial experiments, reported in this
paper, indicate that Galley is capable of providing high-performance I/O to
applications that access data in patterns that have been observed to be
common.</p>
