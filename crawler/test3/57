<h2>old README text</h2> (adapted for historical archiving purposes):
<p>
This directory is an archive of information related to
single-address-space operating systems. It was maintained by 
  Preston Crow, and  David Kotz, Dartmouth College.
<p>
There was an electronic mailing list for people interested in such
systems. The list is archived as a <a href=list-archive.txt>text file</a>.
<p>
old: "Contributions to the directory are welcome. Please send them to one of
us.  We are particularly interested in getting bib entries for any
papers you find that are missing from the bibliography, and a
one-paragraph ASCII description of your research project."
