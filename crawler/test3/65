<b>Multiprocessor File System Interfaces</b>.

<p><b>Abstract:</b> Increasingly, file systems for multiprocessors are designed with
parallel access to multiple disks, to keep I/O from becoming a serious
bottleneck for parallel applications. Although file system software can
transparently provide high-performance access to parallel disks, a new file
system interface is needed to facilitate parallel access to a file from a
parallel application. We describe the difficulties faced when using the
conventional (Unix-like) interface in parallel applications, and then outline
ways to extend the conventional interface to provide convenient access to the
file for parallel programs, while retaining the traditional interface for
programs that have no need for explicitly parallel file access. Our interface
includes a single naming scheme, a  multiopen operation, local and
global file pointers, mapped file pointers, logical records, 
multifiles, and logical coercion for backward compatibility.</p>
