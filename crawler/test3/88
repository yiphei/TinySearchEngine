<p><b>Abstract:</b> Improvements in the processing speed of multiprocessors are
outpacing improvements in the speed of disk hardware. Parallel disk I/O
subsystems have been proposed as one way to close the gap between processor
and disk speeds. In a previous paper we showed that prefetching and caching
have the potential to deliver the performance benefits of parallel file
systems to parallel applications. In this paper we describe experiments with
practical prefetching policies that base decisions only on on-line reference
history, and that can be implemented efficiently. We also test the ability of
these policies across a range of architectural parameters.</p>
