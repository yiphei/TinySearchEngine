<p><b>Abstract:</b> Mobile computing and sensing technologies present exciting
opportunities for healthcare. Prescription wireless sensors worn by patients
can automatically deliver medical data to care providers, dramatically
improving their ability to diagnose, monitor, and manage a range of medical
conditions. Using the mobile phones that patients already carry to provide
connectivity between sensors and providers is essential to keeping costs low
and deployments simple. Unfortunately, software-based attacks against phones
are also on the rise, and successful attacks on privacy-sensitive and
safety-critical applications can have significant consequences for patients.
<P> In this paper, we describe Plug-n-Trust (PnT), a novel approach to
protecting both the confidentiality and integrity of safety-critical medical
sensing and data processing on vulnerable mobile phones. With PnT, a plug-in
smart card provides a trusted computing environment, keeping data safe even
on a compromised mobile phone. By design, PnT is simple to use and deploy,
while providing a flexible programming interface amenable to a wide range of
applications. We describe our implementation, designed for Java-based smart
cards and Android phones, in which we use a split-computation model with a
novel path hashing technique to verify proper behavior without exposing
confidential data. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that PnT achieves
its security goals while incurring acceptable overhead.</p>
