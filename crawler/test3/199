<p><b>Abstract:</b> Wireless network researchers are seriously starved for data about
how real users, applications, and devices use real networks under real
network conditions. CRAWDAD (Community Resource for Archiving Wireless Data
at Dartmouth) is a new National Science Foundation-funded project to build a
wireless-network data archive for the research community. It will host
wireless data and provide tools and documents to make collecting and using
the data easy. This resource should help researchers identify and evaluate
real and interesting problems in mobile and pervasive computing. To learn
more about CRAWDAD and discuss its direction, about 30 interested people
gathered at a workshop held in conjunction with MobiCom 2005.</p>
