<p><b>Abstract:</b> D'Agents is a mobile-agent system that is used primarily for
information-retrieval applications. In this paper, we first examine two such
applications, where mobile agents greatly simplify the task of providing
efficient but application-specific access to remote information resources.
Then we describe the D'Agents system, which supports multiple languages, Tcl,
Java and Scheme, and strong mobility for Tcl and Java. After considering the
D'Agents implementation, we present some recent performance and scalability
experiments that compare D'Agent mobile agents with traditional client/server
approaches. The experiments show that mobile agents often outperform
client/server solutions, but also demonstrate the deep interaction between
environmental and application parameters. The mobile-agent performance space
as a whole is complex, and significant additional experiments are needed to
characterize it. Finally, after discussing current and future experiments, we
explore the differences between D'Agents and other mobile-agent systems.</p>
