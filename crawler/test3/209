<p><b>Abstract:</b> User association logs collected from a large-scale wireless LAN
record where and when a user has used the network. Such information plays an
important role in wireless network research. One concern of sharing these
data with other researchers, however, is that the logs pose potential privacy
risks for the network users. Today, the common practice in sanitizing these
data before releasing them to the public is to anonymize users' sensitive
information, such as their devices' MAC addresses and their exact association
locations. In this work, we aim to study whether such sanitization measures
are sufficient to protect user privacy. By simulating an adversary's role, we
propose a novel type of correlation attack in which the adversary uses the
anonymized association log to build signatures against each user, and when
combined with auxiliary information, such signatures can help to identify
users within the anonymized log. Using a user association log that contains
more than four thousand users and millions of association records, we
demonstrate that this attack technique, under certain circumstances, is able
to pinpoint the victim's identity exactly with a probability as high as 70%,
or narrow it down to a set of 20 candidates with a probability close to
100%.0 We further evaluate the effectiveness of standard anonymization
techniques, including generalization and perturbation, in mitigating
correlation attacks; our experimental results reveal only limited success of
these methods, suggesting that more thorough treatment is needed when
anonymizing wireless user association logs before public release.</p>
