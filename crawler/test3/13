Abstract:

 <P>

Most current multiprocessor file systems are designed to use multiple
disks in parallel, using the high aggregate bandwidth to meet the growing
I/O requirements of parallel scientific applications. Many multiprocessor
file systems provide applications with a conventional Unix-like
interface, allowing the application to access multiple disks
transparently.  This interface conceals the parallelism within the file
system, increasing the ease of programmability, but making it difficult
or impossible for sophisticated programmers and libraries to use
knowledge about their I/O needs to exploit that parallelism.  In addition
to providing an insufficient interface, most current multiprocessor file
systems are optimized for a different workload than they are being asked
to support.  We introduce Galley, a new parallel file system that is
intended to efficiently support realistic scientific multiprocessor
workloads. We discuss Galley's file structure and application interface,
as well as the performance advantages offered by that interface.
