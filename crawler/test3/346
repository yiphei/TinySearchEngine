<p><b>Abstract:</b> Health data collection poses unique challenges in rural areas of
the developing world. mHealth systems that are used by health workers to
collect data in remote rural regions should also record contextual
information to increase confidence in the fidelity of the collected data.
<P> We built a user-friendly, mobile health-data collection system using
wireless medical sensors that interface with an Android application. The
data-collection system was designed to support minimally trained,
non-clinical health workers to gather data about blood pressure and body
weight using off-the-shelf medical sensors. This system comprises a
blood-pressure cuff, a weighing scale and a portable point-of-sales printer.
With this system, we introduced a new method to record contextual information
associated with a blood-pressure reading using a tablet’s touchscreen and
accelerometer. This contextual information can be used to verify that a
patient’s lower arm remained well-supported and stationary during her
blood-pressure measurement. In a preliminary user study, we found that a
binary support vector machine classifier could be used to distinguish
lower-arm movements from stationary arms with 90 0x0.07f6d49b648bp-1022ccuracy. Predetermined
thresholds for the accelerometer readings suffice to determine whether the
tablet, and therefore the arm that rested on it, remained supported.
Together, these two methods can allow mHealth applications to guide untrained
patients (or health workers) in measuring blood pressure correctly. <P>
Usability is a particularly important design and deployment challenge in
remote, rural areas, given the limited resources for technology training and
support. We conducted a field study to assess our system’s usability in
Kolar town, India, where we logged health worker interactions with the
app’s interface using an existing usability toolkit. Researchers analyzed
logs from this toolkit to evaluate the app’s user experience and quantify
specific usability challenges in the app. We have recorded experiential notes
from the field study in this document.</p>
