<H1> The Galley Parallel File System </H1>

Based on the results of several <A href="workload.html"> workload
characterization studies </A> we performed, we have designed and
implemented Galley, a new parallel file system that is intended to meet
the needs of parallel scientific applications. <P>

Galley was designed to run on networks of workstations (NOWs) or
parallel supercomputers.  It currently runs on networks of IBM RS/6000s
(such as our <A href="/research/fleet">FLEET Lab</A>) and the IBM SP-2
parallel supercomputer (such as <A
HREF="http://lovelace.nas.nasa.gov/Parallel/SP2/nas_sp2_home.html">Babbage</A>
at NASA Ames Research Center).<P>

Galley was implemented using a model of distinct Compute Processors and I/O
Processors.  That is, the nodes in the network or parallel machine are
partitioned into two sets: one that runs users' applications and one that
runs Galley's I/O servers.  Even though most NOWs, and some parallel
machines, have disks on each node, Galley uses the distinct CP/IOP model
since it leads to more predictable performance and reduces the performance
impact that one user's application may have on another. <P>

To use the Galley Parallel File System, a user's application must be linked
with the Galley runtime library.  The runtime library establishes
connections with the system's I/O servers, and handles all communication
between the client's code and the servers.  When an application makes a call
to a Galley routine, the runtime library converts the request into an
internal format, and passes it on to the I/O servers via message passing.
The runtime library then controls the flow of data from the IOP to the
application's address space, or vice versa. <P>

  This paper is a combination of the two papers below, with updated
  performance results, and will appear in the journal <em>Parallel
  Computing.</em>

  Performance of the Galley Parallel File System.</EM></a>  Appeared in
  IOPADS '96 

</ul>


Galley makes no pretense to be anything but an experimental file system,
and is missing many of the features that would be required in a
'production' file system.  Most importantly, Galley does not provide any
sort of security or support for
recovery from IOP crashes (<em> i.e.</em>, fsck).

<H3> Source code </H3>

The <a href="galley/galley.tar.Z">full source code</A> for Galley is now
available for downloading.  The code isn't as clean or as fully commented
as I would have liked, but I don't have time to really do a good job on it.<p>

I'm not planning to do any sort of support (unfortunately, this includes
bugfixes), partly since I believe the non-competition clause of my new
employment agreement will prohibit it, and partly because I don't expect
to have time.  If somebody else here at Dartmouth takes up the Galley
banner, someone will make an announcement
to that effect.<p>

Finally, if you find this code useful please let me know.
