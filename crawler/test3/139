<b>Utility Driven Mobile-Agent Scheduling</b>.

<p><b>Abstract:</b> Mobile agents are programs capable of migrating from one host
machine to another. We propose that mobile agents purchase resource access
rights from host machines thereby establishing a market for computational
resources and giving agents a metric to evenly distribute themselves
throughout the network. Market participation requires quantitative
information about resource consumption to define demand and calculate
utility. <P> We create a formal utility model to derive user-demand
functions, allowing agents to efficiently plan expenditure and deal with
price fluctuations. By quantifying demand and utility, resource owners can
precisely set a value for a good. We simulate our model in a mobile agent
scheduling environment and show how mobile agents may use server prices to
distribute themselves evenly throughout a network.</p>
