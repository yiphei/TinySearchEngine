<p><b>Abstract:</b> Modeling movements of users is important for simulating wireless
networks, but current models often do not reflect real movements. Using real
mobility traces, we can build a mobility model that reflects reality. In
building a mobility model, it is important to note that while the number of
handheld wireless devices is constantly increasing, laptops are still the
majority in most cases. As a laptop is often disconnected from the network
while a user is moving, it is not feasible to extract the exact path of the
user from network messages. Thus, instead of modeling individual user's
movements, we model movements in terms of the influx and outflux of users
between access points (APs). We first counted the hourly visits to APs in the
syslog messages recorded at APs. We found that the hourly number of visits
has a periodic repetition of 24 hours. Based on this observation, we
aggregated the visits of multiple days into a single day. We then clustered
APs based on the different peak hour of visits. We found that this approach
of clustering is effective; we ended up with four distinct clusters and a
cluster of stable APs. We then computed the average arrival rate and the
distribution of the daily arrivals for each cluster. Using a standard method
(such as  thinning) for generating non-homogeneous Poisson processes,
synthetic traces can be generated from our model.</p>
