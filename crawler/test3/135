<p><b>Abstract:</b> High-performance computing increasingly occurs on "computational
grids" composed of heterogeneous and geographically distributed systems of
computers, networks, and storage devices that collectively act as a single
"virtual" computer. A key challenge in this environment is to provide
efficient access to data distributed across remote data servers. This
dissertation explores some of the issues associated with I/O for wide-area
distributed computing and describes an I/O system, called Armada, with the
following features: a framework to allow application and dataset providers to
flexibly compose graphs of processing modules that describe the distribution,
application interfaces, and processing required of the dataset before or
after computation; an algorithm to restructure application graphs to increase
parallelism and to improve network performance in a wide-area network; and a
hierarchical graph-partitioning scheme that deploys components of the
application graph in a way that is both beneficial to the application and
sensitive to the administrative policies of the different administrative
domains. Experiments show that applications using Armada perform well in both
low- and high-bandwidth environments, and that our approach does an
exceptional job of hiding the network latency inherent in grid computing.</p>
