<p><b>Abstract:</b> We expect wireless body-area networks of pervasive wearable
devices will enable in situ health monitoring, personal assistance,
entertainment personalization, and home automation. As these devices become
ubiquitous, we also expect them to interoperate. That is, instead of closed,
end-to-end body-worn sensing systems, we envision standardized sensors that
wirelessly communicate their data to a device many people already carry
today, the smart phone. However, this ubiquity of wireless sensors combined
with the characteristics they sense present many security and privacy
problems.<P> In this thesis we describe solutions to two of these problems.
First, we evaluate the use of bioimpedance for recognizing who is wearing
these wireless sensors and show that bioimpedance is a feasible biometric.
Second, we investigate the use of accelerometers for verifying whether two of
these wireless sensors are on the same person and show that our method is
successful as distinguishing between sensors on the same body and on
different bodies. We stress that any solution to these problems must be
usable, meaning the user should not have to do anything but attach the sensor
to their body and have them just work. <P> These methods solve
interesting problems in their own right, but it is the combination of these
methods that shows their true power. Combined together they allow a network
of wireless sensors to cooperate and determine whom they are sensing even
though only one of the wireless sensors might be able to determine this fact.
If all the wireless sensors know they are on the same body as each other and
one of them knows which person it is on, then they can each exploit the
transitive relationship to know that they must all be on that person's body.
We show how these methods can work together in a prototype system. This
ability to operate unobtrusively, collecting in situ data and
labeling it properly without interrupting the wearer's activities of daily
life, will be vital to the success of these wireless sensors.</p>
