<p><b>Abstract:</b> Wearable technology enables a range of exciting new applications
in health, commerce, and beyond. For many important applications, wearables
must have battery life measured in weeks or months, not hours and days as in
most current devices. Our vision of wearable platforms aims for long battery
life but with the flexibility and security to support multiple applications.
To achieve long battery life with a workload comprising apps from multiple
developers, these platforms must have robust mechanisms for app isolation and
developer tools for optimizing resource usage. <P> We introduce the Amulet
Platform for constrained wearable devices, which includes an ultra-low-power
hardware architecture and a companion software framework, including a highly
efficient event-driven programming model, low-power operating system, and
developer tools for profiling ultra-low-power applications at compile time.
We present the design and evaluation of our prototype Amulet hardware and
software, and show how the framework enables developers to write
energy-efficient applications. Our prototype has battery lifetime lasting
weeks or even months, depending on the application, and our interactive
resource-profiling tool predicts battery lifetime within 6-1032536360f the
measured lifetime.</p>
