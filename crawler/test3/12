Abstract:

 <P>

As the I/O needs of parallel scientific applications
increase, file systems for multiprocessors are being designed to
provide applications with parallel access to multiple disks.  Many
parallel file systems present applications with a conventional
Unix-like interface that allows the application to access multiple
disks transparently.  This interface conceals the parallelism within
the file system, which increases the ease of programmability, but makes
it difficult or impossible for sophisticated programmers and libraries
to use knowledge about their I/O needs to exploit that parallelism.
Furthermore, most current parallel file systems are optimized for a
different workload than they are being asked to support.  We introduce
Galley, a new parallel file system that is intended to efficiently
support realistic parallel workloads. We discuss Galley's file
structure and application interface, as well as an application
that has been implemented using that interface.}
