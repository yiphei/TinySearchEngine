<p><b>Abstract:</b> Mesh networks are a potential solution for providing
communication infrastructure in an emergency. They can be rapidly deployed by
first responders in the wake of a major disaster to augment an existing
wireless or wired network. We imagine a mesh node with multiple radios
embedded in each emergency vehicle arriving at the site to form the backbone
of a mobile wireless mesh. The ability of such a mesh network to monitor
itself, diagnose faults and anticipate problems are essential features for
its sustainable operation. Typical SNMP-based centralized solutions introduce
a single point of failure and are unsuitable for managing such a network.
 Mesh-Mon is a decentralized monitoring and management system designed
for such a mobile, rapidly-deployed, unplanned mesh network and works
independently of the underlying mesh routing protocol. Mesh-Mon nodes are
designed to actively cooperate and use localized algorithms to predict,
detect, diagnose and resolve network problems in a scalable manner. Mesh-Mon
is independent of the underlying routing protocol and can operate even if the
mesh routing protocol completely fails. A novel aspect of our approach is
that we employ mobile users of the mesh, running software called 
Mesh-Mon-Ami to ferry management packets between physically-disconnected
partitions in a delay-tolerant network manner. The main contributions of this
paper are the design, implementation and evaluation of a comprehensive
monitoring and management architecture that helps a network administrator
proactively identify, diagnose and resolve a range of issues that can occur
in a dynamic mesh network. In experiments on  Dart-Mesh, our 16-node
indoor mesh testbed, we found Mesh-Mon to be effective in quickly diagnosing
and resolving a variety of problems with high accuracy, without adding
significant management overhead.</p>
