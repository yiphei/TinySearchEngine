<p><b>Abstract:</b> All analytical and simulation research on ad&nbsp;hoc wireless
networks must necessarily model radio propagation using simplifying
assumptions. We provide a comprehensive review of six assumptions that are
still part of many ad&nbsp;hoc network simulation studies, despite increasing
awareness of the need to represent more realistic features, including hills,
obstacles, link asymmetries, and unpredictable fading. We use an extensive
set of measurements from a large outdoor routing experiment to demonstrate
the weakness of these assumptions, and show how these assumptions cause
simulation results to differ significantly from experimental results. We
close with a series of recommendations for researchers, whether they develop
protocols, analytic models, or simulators for ad&nbsp;hoc wireless networks.</p>
