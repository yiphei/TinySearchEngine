<p><b>Abstract:</b> Understanding user mobility is critical for simulations of mobile
devices in a wireless network, but current mobility models often do not
reflect real user movements. In this paper, we provide a foundation for such
work by exploring mobility characteristics in traces of mobile users. We
present a method to estimate the physical location of users from a large
trace of mobile devices associating with access points in a wireless network.
Using this method, we extracted tracks of always-on Wi-Fi devices from a
13-month trace. We discovered that the speed and pause time each follow a
log-normal distribution and that the direction of movements closely reflects
the direction of roads and walkways. Based on the extracted mobility
characteristics, we developed a mobility model, focusing on movements among
popular regions. Our validation shows that synthetic tracks match real tracks
with a median relative error of 17%.0</p>
