<b>ActivityAware: An App for Real-Time Daily Activity Level
Monitoring on the Amulet Wrist-Worn Device</b>.

<p><b>Abstract:</b> Physical activity helps reduce the risk of cardiovascular
disease, hypertension and obesity. The ability to monitor a person’s daily
activity level can inform self-management of physical activity and related
interventions. For older adults with obesity, the importance of regular,
physical activity is critical to reduce the risk of long-term disability. In
this work, we present ActivityAware, an application on the Amulet wrist-worn
device that measures daily activity levels (sedentary, moderate and vigorous)
of individuals, continuously and in real-time. The app implements an
activity-level detection model, continuously collects acceleration data on
the Amulet, classifies the current activity level, updates the day’s
accumulated time spent at that activity level, logs the data for later
analysis, and displays the results on the screen. We developed an
activity-level detection model using a Support Vector Machine (SVM). We
trained our classifiers using data from a user study, where subjects
performed the following physical activities: sit, stand, lay down, walk and
run. With 10-fold cross validation and leave-one-subject-out (LOSO) cross
validation, we obtained preliminary results that suggest accuracies up to
98%, for n=14 subjects. Testing the ActivityAware app revealed a projected
battery life of up to 4 weeks before needing to recharge. The results are
promising, indicating that the app may be used for activity-level monitoring,
and eventually for the development of interventions that could improve the
health of individuals.</p>
