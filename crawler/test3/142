<b>Mobile-Agent Planning in a Market-Oriented Environment</b>.

Revision 1 of May 20, 1999.
<p><b>Abstract:</b> We propose a method for increasing incentives for sites to host
arbitrary mobile agents in which mobile agents purchase their computing needs
from host sites. We present a scalable market-based CPU allocation policy and
an on-line algorithm that plans a mobile agent's expenditure over a multihop
ordered itinerary. The algorithm chooses a set of sites at which to execute
and computational priorities at each site to minimize execution time while
preserving a prespecified budget constraint. We present simulation results of
our algorithm to show that our allocation policy and planning algorithm scale
well as more agents are added to the system.</p>
