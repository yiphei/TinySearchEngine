<b>A Split-Phase Interface for Parallel File Systems</b>.
Technical Report
PCS-TR97-312,
Dartmouth Computer Science,
March 
1997.
<p><b>Abstract:</b> We describe the effects of a new user-level library for the
Galley Parallel File System. This library allows some pre-existing sequential
programs to make use of the Galley Parallel File System with minimal
modification. It permits programs to efficiently use the parallel file system
because the user-level library groups accesses together. We examine the
performance of our library, and we show how code needs to be modified to use
the library.</p>
<p><b>Keywords:</b> parallel computing, file system, parallel-IO</p>
