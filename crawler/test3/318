<p><b>Abstract:</b> More than 100 million Americans are currently living with at
least one chronic health condition and expenditures on chronic diseases
account for more than 75 percent of the \$2.3 trillion cost of our healthcare
system. To improve chronic illness care, patients must be empowered and
engaged in health self-management. However, only half of all patients with
chronic illness comply with treatment regimen. The self-regulation model,
while seemingly valuable, needs practical tools to help patients adopt this
self-centered approach for long-term care. <P> In this position paper, we
propose Mobile-phone based Patient Compliance System (MPCS) that can reduce
the time-consuming and error-prone processes of existing self-regulation
practice to facilitate self-reporting, non-compliance detection, and
compliance reminders. The novelty of this work is to apply social-behavior
theories to engineer the MPCS to positively influence patients' compliance
behaviors, including mobile-delivered contextual reminders based on
association theory; mobile-triggered questionnaires based on self-perception
theory; and mobile-enabled social interactions based on social-construction
theory. We discuss the architecture and the research challenges to realize
the proposed MPCS.</p>
