<b>Supporting Adaptive Ubiquitous Applications with the SOLAR
System</b>.
Technical Report

Dartmouth Computer Science,

<p><b>Abstract:</b> As we embed more computers into our daily environment, ubiquitous
computing promises to make them less noticeable and help to prevent
information overload. We see, however, few ubiquitous applications that are
able to adapt to the dynamics of user, physical, and computational context.
We believe that there are two challenges causing this lack of ubiquitous
applications: there is no flexible and scalable way to support information
collection and dissemination in a ubiquitous and mobile environment, and
there is no general approach to building adaptive applications given
heterogeneous contextual information. We propose a system infrastructure,
Solar, to meet these challenges. Solar uses a subscription-based operator
graph abstraction and allows dynamic composition of stackable operators to
manage ubiquitous information sources. After developing a set of diverse
adaptive applications, we expect to identify fundamental techniques for
context-aware adaptation. Our expectation is that Solar's end-to-end support
for information collection, dissemination, and utilization will make it easy
to build adaptive applications for a ubiquitous mobile environment with many
users and devices.</p>
