<p><b>Abstract:</b> Mobile agents are programs that can migrate from machine to
machine in a heterogeneous, partially disconnected network. As mobile agents
move across a network, they consume resources. We discuss a system for
controlling the activities of mobile agents that uses electronic cash, a
banking system, and a set of resource managers. We describe protocols for
transactions between agents. We present fixed-pricing and dynamic-pricing
policies for resources. We focus on and analyze the sealed-bid second-price
auction as a mechanism for dynamic pricing.</p>
