<b>An Assessment of Single-Channel EMG Sensing for Gestural Input</b>.

<p><b>Abstract:</b> Wearable devices of all kinds are becoming increasingly popular.
One problem that plagues wearable devices, however, is how to interact with
them. In this paper we construct a prototype electromyography (EMG) sensing
device that captures a single channel of EMG sensor data corresponding to
user gestures. We also implement a machine learning pipeline to recognize
gestural input received via our prototype sensing device. Our goal is to
assess the feasibility of using a BITalino EMG sensor to recognize gestural
input on a mobile health (mHealth) wearable device known as Amulet. We
conduct three experiments in which we use the EMG sensor to collect gestural
input data from (1) the wrist, (2) the forearm, and (3) the bicep. Our
results show that a single channel EMG sensor located near the wrist may be a
viable approach to reliably recognizing simple gestures without mistaking
them for common daily activities such as drinking from a cup, walking, or
talking while moving your arms.</p>
