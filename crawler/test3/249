<p><b>Abstract:</b> Many network services may be improved or enabled by successful
predictions of users' future mobility. The success of predictions depend on
how much accuracy can be achieved on real data and on the sensitivity of
particular applications to this achievable accuracy. We investigate these
issues for the case of advanced bandwidth reservation using real WLAN traces
collected on the Dartmouth College campus.</p>
