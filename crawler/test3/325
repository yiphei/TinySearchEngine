<b>Hide-n-Sense: Privacy-aware secure mHealth sensing</b>.
Technical Report
TR2011-702,
Dartmouth Computer Science,
September 
2011.
<p><b>Abstract:</b> As healthcare in many countries faces an aging population and
rising costs, mobile sensing technologies promise a new opportunity. Using
mobile health (mHealth) sensing, which uses medical sensors to collect data
about the patients, and mobile phones to act as a gateway between sensors and
electronic health record systems, caregivers can continuously monitor the
patients and deliver better care. Furthermore, individuals can become better
engaged in monitoring and managing their own health. Although some work on
mHealth sensing has addressed security, achieving strong privacy for
low-power sensors remains a challenge. <P> We make three contributions.
First, we propose an mHealth sensing protocol that provides strong security
and privacy properties with low energy overhead, suitable for low-power
sensors. The protocol uses three novel techniques: adaptive security, to
dynamically modify transmission overhead; MAC striping, to make forgery
difficult even for small-sized MACs; and an asymmetric resource requirement.
Second, we demonstrate a prototype on a Chronos wrist device, and evaluate it
experimentally. Third, we provide a security, privacy, and energy analysis of
our system.</p>
