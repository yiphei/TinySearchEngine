<p><b>Abstract:</b> Ubiquitous-computing environments are heterogeneous and volatile
in nature. Systems that support ubicomp applications must be self-managed, to
reduce human intervention. In this paper, we present a general service that
helps distributed software components to manage their dependencies. Our
service proactively monitors the liveness of components and recovers them
according to supplied policies. Our service also tracks the state of
components, on behalf of their dependents, and may automatically select
components for the dependent to use based on evaluations of customized
functions. We believe that our approach is flexible and abstracts away many
of the complexities encountered in ubicomp environments. In particular, we
show how we applied the service to manage dependencies of context-fusion
operators and present some experimental results.</p>
