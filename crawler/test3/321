<b>On Usable Authentication for Wireless Body Area Networks</b>.
In
<i>USENIX Workshop on Health Security (HealthSec)</i>,
August 
2010.
Position paper.
<p><b>Abstract:</b> We examine a specific security problem in wireless body area
networks (WBANs), what we call the \it one body authentication problem.
That is, how can we ensure that the wireless sensors in a WBAN are collecting
data about one individual and not several individuals. We explore existing
solutions to this problem and provide some analysis why these solutions are
inadequate. Finally, we provide some direction towards a promising solution
to the problem and how it can be used to create a usably secure WBAN.</p>
