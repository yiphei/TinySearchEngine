<b>The Expected Lifetime of ``Single-Address-Space'' Operating
Systems</b>.

<p><b>Abstract:</b> Trends toward shared-memory programming paradigms, large (64-bit)
address spaces, and memory-mapped files have led some to propose the use of a
single virtual-address space, shared by all processes and processors. To
simplify address-space management, some have claimed that a 64-bit address
space is sufficiently large that there is no need to ever re-use addresses.
Unfortunately, there has been no data to either support or refute these
claims, or to aid in the design of appropriate address-space management
policies. In this paper, we present the results of extensive kernel-level
tracing of the workstations on our campus, and discuss the implications for
single-address-space operating systems. We found that single-address-space
systems will probably not outgrow the available address space, but only if
reasonable space-allocation policies are used, and only if the system can
adapt as larger address spaces become available.</p>
