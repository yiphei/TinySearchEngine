<p><b>Abstract:</b> All analytical and simulation research on ad hoc wireless
networks must necessarily model radio propagation using simplifying
assumptions. A growing body of research, however, indicates that the behavior
of the protocol stack may depend significantly on these underlying
assumptions. The standard response to this problem is a call for more realism
in designing radio models. But how much realism is enough? This study is the
first to approach this question by validating simulator performance (both at
the physical and application layers) with the results of real-world data.
Referencing an extensive set of measurements from a large outdoor routing
experiment, we start by evaluating the relative realism of common assumptions
made in radio model design, identifying those which provide a reasonable
approximation of reality. Although several such investigations have been made
for static sensor networks, radio behavior in mobile network deployments is a
much less-studied topic. We then reproduce our experimental setup in our
simulator, and generate the same application-layer metrics under
progressively smaller sets of these assumptions. By comparing the simulated
outcome to the outcome of our experiment, we are able to discern at what
point our balance of simplification and realism captures the real behavior of
our target environment.</p>
