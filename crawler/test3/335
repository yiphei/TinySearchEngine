<p><b>Abstract:</b> In an open mobile health (mHealth) sensing system, users will be
able to seamlessly pair sensors with their cellphone and expect the system to
just work. This ubiquity of sensors, however, creates the potential for users
to accidentally wear sensors that are not paired with their own cellphone.
Our method probabilistically detects this situation by finding correlations
between embedded accelerometers in the cellphone and sensor. We evaluate our
method over a dataset of seven individuals with sensors in various positions
on their body and experimentally show that our method is capable of achieving
an accuracy of 85%.0</p>
