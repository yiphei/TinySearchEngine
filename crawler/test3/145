<p><b>Abstract:</b> Mobile-agent systems allow user programs to autonomously relocate
from one host site to another. This autonomy provides a powerful, flexible
architecture on which to build distributed applications. The asynchronous,
decentralized nature of mobile-agent systems makes them flexible, but also
hinders their deployment. We argue that a market-based approach where agents
buy computational resources from their hosts solves many problems faced by
mobile-agent systems. <P> In our earlier work, we propose a policy for
allocating general computational priority among agents posed as a competitive
game for which we derive a unique computable Nash equilibrium. Here we
improve on our earlier approach by implementing resource guarantees where
mobile-agent hosts issue call options on computational resources. Call
options allow an agent to reserve and guarantee the cost and time necessary
to complete its itinerary before the agent begins execution. <P> We present
an algorithm based upon the binomial options-pricing model that estimates
future congestion to allow hosts to evaluate call options; methods for agents
to measure the risk associated with their performance and compare their
expected utility of competing in the computational spot market with utilizing
resource options; and test our theory with simulations to show that option
trade reduces variance in agent completion times.</p>
