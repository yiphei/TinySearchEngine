<p><b>Abstract:</b> Improvements in the processing speed of multiprocessors are
outpacing improvements in the speed of disk hardware. Parallel disk I/O
subsystems have been proposed as one way to close the gap between processor
and disk speeds. Such parallel disk systems require parallel file system
software to avoid performance-limiting bottlenecks. We discuss cache
management techniques that can be used in a parallel file system
implementation for multiprocessors with scientific workloads. We examine
several writeback policies, and give results of experiments that test their
performance.</p>
