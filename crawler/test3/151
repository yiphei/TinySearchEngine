<p><b>Abstract:</b> As network information resources grow in size, it is often most
efficient to process queries and updates at the site where the data is
located. This processing can be accomplished by using a traditional
client-server network interface, which constrains the client to the set of
queries supported by the server, or requires the server to send all data to
the client for processing. The former is inflexible; the latter is
inefficient. Transportable agents, which support the movement of the client
computation to the location of the remote resource, have the potential to be
more flexible and more efficient. Transportable agents are capable of
suspending their execution, transporting themselves to another host on a
network, and resuming execution from the point at which they were suspended.
Transportable agents consume fewer network resources and can support systems
that do not have permanent network connections, such as mobile computers and
personal digital assistants. We describe a prototype transportable-agent
implementation that facilitates research in this area. Agents are written in
a script language that supports agent relocation, and the language is
processed at each host by an agent interpreter. Electronic mail is the
current transport mechanism and we plan to explore others. We present a
technical-report searching agent as a demonstration of the capabilities of
our prototype implementation.</p>
