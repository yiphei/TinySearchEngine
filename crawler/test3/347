<p><b>Abstract:</b> We propose a new method to record contextual information
associated with a blood-pressure reading using a tablet's touchscreen and
accelerometer. This contextual information can be used to verify that a
patient's lower arm remained well-supported and stationary during her
blood-pressure measurement. We found that a binary support vector machine
classifier could be used to distinguish different types of lower-arm
movements from stationary arms with 90 0x0.07f6d49b648bp-1022ccuracy overall. Predetermined
thresholds for the accelerometer readings suffice to determine whether the
tablet, and therefore the arm that rested on it, remained supported.
Together, these two methods can allow mHealth applications to guide untrained
patients (or health workers) in measuring blood pressure correctly.</p>
