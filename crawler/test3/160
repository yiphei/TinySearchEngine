<b>AGDB: A Debugger for Agent Tcl</b>.
Technical Report
PCS-TR97-306,
Dartmouth Computer Science,
February 
1997.
<p><b>Abstract:</b> The Agent Tcl language is an extension of Tcl/Tk that supports
distributed programming in the form of transportable agents. AGDB is a
debugger for the Agent Tcl language. AGDB mixes of traditional and
distributed debugging facilities. Traditional debugging features include
breakpoints (line-specific, conditional, and once-only), watch conditions and
variables, and interrupts. Distributed-debugging features address issues
inherent in distributed programming such as migration and communication.
These capabilities make debugging distributed programs difficult because they
add complexities like race conditions to the set of problems a program can
encounter. This paper discusses how AGDB uses distributed debugging features
to debug agents.</p>
