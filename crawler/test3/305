<b>People-Centric Urban Sensing: Security Challenges for the New
Paradigm</b>.
Technical Report

Dartmouth Computer Science,
February

<p><b>Abstract:</b> We study the security challenges that arise in 
people-centric urban sensing, a new sensor-networking paradigm that
leverages humans as part of the sensing infrastructure. Most prior work on
sensor networks has focused on collecting and processing ephemeral data about
the environment using a static topology and an application-aware
infrastructure. People-centric urban sensing, however, involves collecting,
storing, processing and fusing large volumes of data related to every-day
human activities. Sensing is performed in a highly dynamic and mobile
environment, and supports (among other things) pervasive computing
applications that are focused on enhancing the user's experience. In such a
setting, where humans are the central focus, there are new challenges for
information security; not only because of the complex and dynamic
communication patterns, but also because the data originates from sensors
that are carried by a person--not a tiny sensor thrown in the forest or
mounted on the neck of an animal. In this paper we aim to instigate
discussion about this critical issue--because people-centric sensing will
never succeed without adequate provisions for security and privacy. To that
end, we outline several important challenges and suggest general solutions
that hold promise in this new paradigm of sensor networks.</p>
