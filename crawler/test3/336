<b>Who wears me? Bioimpedance as a passive biometric</b>.

<p><b>Abstract:</b> Mobile and wearable systems for monitoring health are becoming
common. If such an mHealth system knows the identity of its wearer, the
system can properly label and store data collected by the system. Existing
recognition schemes for such mobile applications and pervasive devices are
not particularly usable&nbsp;- they require \it active engagement with the
person (e.g., the input of passwords), or they are too easy to fool (e.g.,
they depend on the presence of a device that is easily stolen or lost). <P>
We present a wearable sensor to passively recognize people. Our sensor uses
the unique electrical properties of a person's body to recognize their
identity. More specifically, the sensor uses \it bioimpedance&nbsp;- a measure
of how the body's tissues oppose a tiny applied alternating current&nbsp;- and
learns how a person's body uniquely responds to alternating current of
different frequencies. In this paper we demonstrate the feasibility of our
system by showing its effectiveness at accurately recognizing people in a
household 9032536360f the time.</p>
