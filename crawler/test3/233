<p><b>Abstract:</b> The edge of the Internet is increasingly wireless. To understand
the Internet, one must understand the edge, and yet the measurement of
wireless networks poses many new challenges. IEEE 802.11 networks support
multiple wireless channels and any monitoring technique involves capturing
traffic on each of these channels to gather a representative sample of frames
from the network. We call this procedure channel sampling, in which
each sniffer visits each channel periodically, resulting in a sample of the
traffic on each of the channels. <P> This sampling approach may be
sufficient, for example, for a system administrator or anomaly detection
module to observe some unusual behavior in the network. Once an anomaly is
detected, however, the administrator may require a more extensive traffic
sample, or need to identify the location of an offending device. <P> We
propose a method to allow measurement applications to dynamically modify the
sampling strategy, refocusing the monitoring system to pay more
attention to certain types of traffic than others. In this paper we show that
refocusing is a necessary and promising new technique for wireless
measurement.</p>
