<p><b>Abstract:</b> Mobile technology has significant potential to help revolutionize
personal wellness and the delivery of healthcare. Mobile phones, wearable
sensors, and home-based tele-medicine devices can help caregivers and
individuals themselves better monitor and manage their health. While the
potential benefits of this ``mHealth'' technology include better health, more
effective healthcare, and reduced cost, this technology also poses
significant security and privacy challenges. In this paper we propose
Amulet, an mHealth architecture that provides strong security and
privacy guarantees while remaining easy to use, and outline the research and
engineering challenges required to realize the Amulet vision.</p>
