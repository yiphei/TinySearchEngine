<p><b>Abstract:</b> In this demonstration we present the Amulet Platform; a hardware
and software platform for developing energy- and resource-efficient
applications on multi-application wearable devices. This platform, which
includes the Amulet Firmware Toolchain, the Amulet Runtime, the ARP-View
graphical tool, and open reference hardware, efficiently protects
applications from each other without MMU support, allows developers to
interactively explore how their implementation decisions impact battery life
without the need for hardware modeling and additional software development,
and represents a new approach to developing long-lived wearable applications.
We envision the Amulet Platform enabling long-duration experiments on human
subjects in a wide variety of studies.</p>
