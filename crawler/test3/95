<p><b>Abstract:</b> New file systems are critical to obtain good I/O performance on
large multiprocessors. Several researchers have suggested the use of 
collective file-system operations, in which all processes in an
application cooperate in each I/O request. Others have suggested that the
traditional low-level interface (\tt read, write, seek) be augmented with
various higher-level requests (e.g.,  read matrix). Collective,
high-level requests permit a technique called  disk-directed I/O to
significantly improve performance over traditional file systems and
interfaces, at least on simple I/O benchmarks. In this paper, we present the
results of experiments with an ``out-of-core'' LU-decomposition program.
Although its collective interface was awkward in some places, and forced
additional synchronization, disk-directed I/O was able to obtain much better
overall performance than the traditional system.</p>
