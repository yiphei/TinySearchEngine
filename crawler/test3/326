<b>Adaptive security and privacy for mHealth sensing</b>.

Short paper.
<p><b>Abstract:</b> As healthcare in many countries faces an aging population and
rising costs, mobile Health (mHealth) sensing technologies promise a new
opportunity. However, the privacy concerns associated with mHealth sensing
are a limiting factor for their widespread adoption. The use of wireless body
area networks pose a particular challenge. Although there exist protocols
that provide a secure and private communication channel between two devices,
the large transmission overhead associated with these protocols limit their
application to low-power mHealth sensing devices. We propose an adaptive
security model that enables use of privacy-preserving protocols in low-power
mHealth sensing by reducing the network overhead in the transmissions, while
maintaining the security and privacy properties provided by the protocols.</p>
