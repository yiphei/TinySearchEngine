<p><b>Abstract:</b> Many scientific applications for high-performance multiprocessors
have tremendous I/O requirements. As a result, the I/O system is often the
limiting factor of application performance. Several new parallel file systems
have been developed in recent years, each promising better performance for
some class of parallel applications. As we gain experience with parallel
computing, and parallel file systems in particular, it becomes increasingly
clear that a single solution does not suit all applications. For example, it
appears to be impossible to find a single appropriate interface, caching
policy, file structure, or disk management strategy. Furthermore, the
proliferation of file-system interfaces and abstractions make application
portability a significant problem. <P> We propose that the traditional
functionality of parallel file systems be separated into two components: a
fixed core that is standard on all platforms, encapsulating only primitive
abstractions and interfaces, and a set of high-level libraries to provide a
variety of abstractions and application-programmer interfaces (APIs). We
think of this approach as the ``RISC'' of parallel file-system design. <P>
We present our current and next-generation file systems as examples of this
structure. Their features, such as a three-dimensional file structure,
strided read and write interfaces, and I/O-node programs, are specifically
designed with the flexibility and performance necessary to support a wide
range of applications.</p>
