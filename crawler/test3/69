<p><b>Abstract:</b> Several algorithms for parallel disk systems have appeared in the
literature recently, and they are asymptotically optimal in terms of the
number of disk accesses. Scalable systems with parallel disks must be able to
run these algorithms. We present for the first time a list of capabilities
that must be provided by the system to support these optimal algorithms:
control over declustering, querying about the configuration, independent I/O,
and turning off parity, file caching, and prefetching. We summarize recent
theoretical and empirical work that justifies the need for these
capabilities. In addition, we sketch an organization for a parallel file
interface with low-level primitives and higher-level operations.</p>
