<p><b>Abstract:</b> We sketch the reasons for the I/O bottleneck in parallel and
distributed systems, pointing out that it can be viewed as a special case of
a general bottleneck that arises at all levels of the memory hierarchy. We
argue that because of its severity, the I/O bottleneck deserves systematic
attention at all levels of system design. We then present a survey of the
issues raised by the I/O bottleneck in six key areas of parallel and
distributed systems: applications, algorithms, languages and compilers,
run-time libraries, operating systems, and architecture.</p>
<p><b>Keywords:</b> survey, parallel-IO, parallel computing, file system</p>
