<b>Solar: Building A Context Fusion Network for Pervasive Computing</b>.

<p><b>Abstract:</b> The complexity of developing context-aware pervasive-computing
applications calls for distributed software infrastructures that assist
applications to collect, aggregate, and disseminate contextual data. In this
dissertation, we present a Context Fusion Network (CFN), called Solar, which
is built with a scalable and self-organized service overlay. Solar is
flexible and allows applications to select distributed data sources and
compose them with customized data-fusion operators into a directed acyclic
information flow graph. Such a graph represents how an application computes
high-level understandings of its execution context from low-level sensory
data. To manage application-specified operators on a set of overlay nodes
called Planets, Solar provides several unique services such as
application-level multicast with policy-driven data reduction to handle
buffer overflow, context-sensitive resource discovery to handle environment
dynamics, and proactive monitoring and recovery to handle common failures.
Experimental results show that these services perform well on a typical
DHT-based peer-to-peer routing substrate. In this dissertation, we also
discuss experience, insights, and lessons learned from our quantitative
analysis of the input sensors, a detailed case study of a Solar application,
and development of other applications in different domains.</p>
