<p><b>Abstract:</b> We study the security challenges that arise in
opportunistic people-centric sensing, a new sensing paradigm
leveraging humans as part of the sensing infrastructure. Most prior
sensor-network research has focused on collecting and processing
environmental data using a static topology and an application-aware
infrastructure, whereas opportunistic sensing involves collecting, storing,
processing and fusing large volumes of data related to everyday human
activities. This highly dynamic and mobile setting, where humans are the
central focus, presents new challenges for information security, because data
originates from sensors carried by people-- not tiny sensors thrown in the
forest or attached to animals. In this paper we aim to instigate discussion
of this critical issue, because opportunistic people-centric sensing will
never succeed without adequate provisions for security and privacy. To that
end, we outline several important challenges and suggest general solutions
that hold promise in this new sensing paradigm.</p>
