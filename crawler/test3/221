<p><b>Abstract:</b> Measuring wireless local area networks has proven useful for
characterizing, modeling and provisioning these networks. These measurements
are typically taken passively from a vantage point on the network itself.
Client devices, or users, are never actively queried. These measurements can
indicate  what is happening on the network, but it can be difficult to
infer  why a particular behavior is occurring. In this paper we use the
Experience Sampling Method (ESM) to study wireless network users. We
monitored 29 users remotely for one week, and signaled them to fill out a
questionnaire whenever interesting wireless behavior was observed. We find
ESM to be a useful method for collecting data about wireless network usage
that cannot be provided by network monitoring, and we present a list of
recommendations for network researchers who wish to conduct an ESM study.</p>
