<b>Exploring the use of I/O Nodes for Computation in a MIMD
Multiprocessor</b>.

Revised 2/20/95.
<p><b>Abstract:</b> Most MIMD multiprocessors today are configured with two distinct
types of processor nodes: those that have disks attached, which are dedicated
to file I/O, and those that do not have disks attached, which are used for
running applications. Several architectural trends have led some to propose
configuring systems so that all processors are used for application
processing, even those with disks attached. We examine this idea
experimentally, focusing on the impact of remote I/O requests on local
computational processes. We found that in an efficient file system the I/O
processors can transfer data at near peak speeds with little CPU overhead,
leaving substantial CPU power for running applications. On the other hand, we
found that some complex file-system features could require substantial CPU
overhead. Thus, for a multiprocessor system to obtain good I/O and
computational performance on a mix of applications, the file system (both
operating system and libraries) must be prepared to adapt their policies to
changing conditions.</p>
