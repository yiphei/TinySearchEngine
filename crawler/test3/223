<p><b>Abstract:</b> Wireless hotspot networks have become increasingly popular in
recent years as a means of providing Internet access in public areas such as
restaurants and airports. In this paper we present the first study of such a
hotspot network. We examine five weeks of SNMP traces from the Verizon Wi-Fi
HotSpot network in Manhattan. We find that far more cards associated to the
network than logged into it. Most clients used the network infrequently and
visited few APs. AP utilization was uneven and the network displayed some
unusual patterns in traffic load. Some characteristics were similar to those
previously observed in studies of campus WLANs.</p>
