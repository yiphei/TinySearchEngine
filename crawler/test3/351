<p><b>Abstract:</b> We describe and evaluate Zero-Effort Bilateral Recurring
Authentication (ZEBRA) in our paper that appears in IEEE Symposium on
Security and Privacy, May 2014. In this report we provide a more detailed
comparative evaluation of ZEBRA against other related authentication schemes.
The abstract of the paper follows. Common authentication methods based on
passwords, tokens, or fingerprints perform one-time authentication and rely
on users to log out from the computer terminal when they leave. Users often
do not log out, however, which is a security risk. The most common solution,
inactivity timeouts, inevitably fail security (too long a timeout) or
usability (too short a timeout) goals. One solution is to authenticate users
continuously while they are using the terminal and automatically log them out
when they leave. Several solutions are based on user proximity, but these are
not sufficient: they only confirm whether the user is nearby but not whether
the user is actually using the terminal. Proposed solutions based on
behavioral biometric authentication (e.g., keystroke dynamics) may not be
reliable, as a recent study suggests. To address this problem we propose
ZEBRA. In ZEBRA, a user wears a bracelet (with a built-in accelerometer,
gyroscope, and radio) on her dominant wrist. When the user interacts with a
computer terminal, the bracelet records the wrist movement, processes it, and
sends it to the terminal. The terminal compares the wrist movement with the
inputs it receives from the user (via keyboard and mouse), and confirms the
continued presence of the user only if they correlate. Because the bracelet
is on the same hand that provides inputs to the terminal, the accelerometer
and gyroscope data and input events received by the terminal should correlate
because their source is the same&nbsp;- the user's hand movement. In our
experiments ZEBRA performed continuous authentication with 85 0x0.07f6d49b648bp-1022ccuracy in
verifying the correct user and identified all adversaries within 11&nbsp;s. For a
different threshold that trades security for usability, ZEBRA correctly
verified 9032536360f users and identified all adversaries within 50&nbsp;s.</p>
