<p><b>Abstract:</b> Recent years have witnessed a new class of monitoring
applications that need to continuously collect information from remote data
sources. Those data sources, such as web click-streams, stock quotes, and
sensor data, are often characterized as fast-rate high-volume ``streams''.
Distributed stream-processing systems are thus designed to efficiently use
system resources to serve the data-acquisition needs of the applications.
Most of the state-of-the-art stream-processing systems assume an
Ethernet-based network whose bandwidth is abundant, and focus on mechanisms
to save computational power and memory. For applications involving wireless
networks, particularly multi-hop mesh networks, we recognize that the most
limiting factor in efficiently processing streams lies in the network's
highly constrained bandwidth. Hence, this dissertation proposes a group-aware
stream filtering approach that saves bandwidth at the cost of increased CPU
time, for low-bandwidth data-streaming systems. This approach, used together
with multicasting, exploits two overlooked properties of monitoring
applications: 1) many of them can tolerate some degree of ``slack'' in their
data quality requirements, and 2) there may exist multiple subsets of the
source data satisfying the quality needs of an application. We can thus
choose the ``best alternative'' subset for each application to maximize the
data overlap within the group to best benefit from multicasting. After
proving the problem NP-hard, we introduce a suite of heuristics-based
algorithms that ensure data quality, specifically data granularity and
timeliness, in addition to preserving network bandwidth. Our framework for
group-aware stream filtering is extensible and supports a diverse range of
filtering needs of monitoring applications. We evaluate this approach with a
prototype system based on real-world data sets. The results show that
quality-managed group-aware filtering is effective in trading CPU time for
bandwidth savings, compared with self-interested stream filtering. We also
evaluate the effect of each algorithm on temporal freshness of the data.
Finally, we discuss other application realms that might benefit from
group-aware stream filtering.</p>
