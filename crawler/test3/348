<p><b>Abstract:</b> Interest in using mobile technologies for health-related
applications (mHealth) has increased. However, none of the available mobile
platforms provide the essential properties that are needed by these
applications. An mHealth platform must be (i) secure; (ii) provide high
availability; and (iii) allow for the deployment of multiple third-party
mHealth applications that share access to an individual's devices and data.
Smartphones may not be able to provide property (ii) because there are
activities and situations in which an individual may not be able to carry
them (e.g., while in a contact sport). A low-power wearable device can
provide higher availability, remaining attached to the user during most
activities. Furthermore, some mHealth applications require integrating
multiple on-body or near-body devices, some owned by a single individual, but
others shared with multiple individuals. In this paper, we propose a secure
system architecture for a low-power bracelet that can run multiple
applications and manage access to shared resources in a body-area mHealth
network. The wearer can install a personalized mix of third-party
applications to support the monitoring of multiple medical conditions or
wellness goals, with strong security safeguards. Our preliminary
implementation and evaluation supports the hypothesis that our approach
allows for the implementation of a resource monitor on far less power than
would be consumed by a mobile device running Linux or Android. Our
preliminary experiments demonstrate that our secure architecture would enable
applications to run for several weeks on a small wearable device without
recharging.</p>
