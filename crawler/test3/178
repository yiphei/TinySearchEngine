<b>Future Directions for Mobile-Agent Research</b>.
<i>IEEE Distributed Systems Online</i>,
3(8),
August 
2002.
Based on a conversation with Jeff Bradshaw, Colin Harrison, Guenter
Karjoth, Amy Murphy, Gian Pietro Picco, M. Ranganathan, Niranjan Suri, and
Christian Tschudin.
<p><b>Abstract:</b> The field of mobile agents should shift its emphasis toward
mobile code, in all its forms, rather than continue focusing on mobile
agents. The development of modular components will help application designers
take advantage of code mobility without having to rewrite their applications
to fit in monolithic, mobile agent systems.</p>
