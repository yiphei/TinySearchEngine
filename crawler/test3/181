<p><b>Abstract:</b> A mobile agent is an executing program that can migrate, at times
of its own choosing, from machine to machine in a heterogeneous network. On
each machine, the agent interacts with stationary service agents and other
resources to accomplish its task. In this chapter, we first make the case for
mobile agents, discussing six strengths of mobile agents and the applications
that benefit from these strengths. Although none of these strengths are
unique to mobile agents, no competing technique shares all six. In other
words, a mobile-agent system provides a single general framework in which a
wide range of distributed applications can be implemented efficiently and
easily. We then present a representative cross-section of current
mobile-agent systems.</p>
