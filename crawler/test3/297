<b>Controlling access to pervasive information in the ``Solar''
system</b>.

<p><b>Abstract:</b> Pervasive-computing infrastructures necessarily collect a lot of
context information to disseminate to their context-aware applications. Due
to the personal or proprietary nature of much of this context information,
however, the infrastructure must limit access to context information to
authorized persons. In this paper we propose a new access-control mechanism
for event-based context-distribution infrastructures. The core of our
approach is based on a conservative information-flow model of access control,
but users may express discretionary relaxation of the resulting
access-control list (ACL) by specifying relaxation functions. This
combination of automatic ACL derivation and user-specified ACL relaxation
allows access control to be determined and enforced in a decentralized,
distributed system with no central administrator or central policy maker. It
also allows users to express their personal balance between functionality and
privacy. Finally, our infrastructure allows access-control policies to depend
on context-sensitive roles, allowing great flexibility. <P> We describe our
approach in terms of a specific context-dissemination framework, the Solar
system, although the same principles would apply to systems with similar
properties.</p>
