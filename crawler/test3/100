<b>Tuning STARFISH</b>.
Technical Report
PCS-TR96-296,
Dartmouth Computer Science,
October 
1996.
<p><b>Abstract:</b> STARFISH is a parallel file-system simulator we built for our
research into the concept of disk-directed I/O. In this report, we detail
steps taken to tune the file systems supported by STARFISH, which include a
traditional parallel file system (with caching) and a disk-directed I/O
system. In particular, we now support two-phase I/O, use smarter disk
scheduling, increased the maximum number of outstanding requests that a
compute processor may make to each disk, and added gather/scatter block
transfer. We also present results of the experiments driving the tuning
effort.</p>
<p><b>Keywords:</b> parallel-IO, parallel computing, file system</p>
