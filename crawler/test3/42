<p><b>Abstract:</b> Parallelism is the future of computing and computer science and
should therefore be at the heart of the CS curriculum. Instead of continuing
along the evolutionary path by introducing parallel computation ``top down''
(first in special junior-senior level courses), we are taking a radical
approach and introducing parallelism at the earliest possible stages of
instruction. Specifically, we are developing a completely new freshman-level
course on data structures that integrates parallel computation naturally, and
retains the emphasis on laboratory instruction. This will help to steer our
curriculum as expeditiously as possible toward parallel computing. <P> Our
approach is novel in three distinct and essential ways. First, we will teach
parallel computing to freshmen in a course designed from beginning to end to
do so. Second, we will motivate the course with examples from scientific
computation. Third, we use multimedia and visualization as instructional
aids. We have two primary objectives: to begin a reform of our undergraduate
curriculum with an laboratory-based freshman course on parallel computation,
and to produce tools and methodologies that improve student understanding of
the basic principles of parallel computing.</p>
