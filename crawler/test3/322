<p><b>Abstract:</b> Mobile sensing technologies present exciting opportunities for
healthcare. Wireless sensors can automatically provide sensor data to care
providers, dramatically improving their ability to diagnose, monitor, and
manage a wide range of medical conditions. Using mobile phones to provide
connectivity between sensors and providers is essential to keeping costs low
and deployments simple. Unfortunately, software-based attacks against phones,
which can have significant consequences for patients, are also on the rise.
<P> This poster describes a simple, flexible, and novel approach to
protecting both the confidentiality and integrity medical sensing and data
processing on vulnerable mobile phones, using plug-in smart cards--even a
phone compromised by malware. We describe our design, implementation, and
initial experimental results using real smart cards and Android smartphones.</p>
