<b>Expanding the Potential for Disk-Directed I/O</b>.
Technical Report
PCS-TR95-254,
Dartmouth Computer Science,
March 
1995.
<p><b>Abstract:</b> As parallel computers are increasingly used to run scientific
applications with large data sets, and as processor speeds continue to
increase, it becomes more important to provide fast, effective parallel file
systems for data storage and for temporary files. In an earlier work we
demonstrated that a technique we call disk-directed I/O has the potential to
provide consistent high performance for large, collective, structured I/O
requests. In this paper we expand on this potential by demonstrating the
ability of a disk-directed I/O system to read irregular subsets of data from
a file, and to filter and distribute incoming data according to
data-dependent functions.</p>
<p><b>Keywords:</b> parallel-IO, parallel computing, file systems</p>
