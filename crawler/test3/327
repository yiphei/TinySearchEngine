<p><b>Abstract:</b> Networked mobile devices have great potential to enable
individuals (and their physicians) to better monitor their health and to
manage medical conditions. In this paper, we examine the privacy-related
threats to these so-called mHealth technologies. We develop a
taxonomy of the privacy-related threats, and discuss some of the technologies
that could support privacy-sensitive mHealth systems. We conclude with a
brief summary of research challenges.</p>
