<p><b>Abstract:</b> Body-area networks of pervasive wearable devices are increasingly
used for health monitoring, personal assistance, entertainment, and home
automation. In an ideal world, a user would simply wear their desired set of
devices with no configuration necessary: the devices would discover each
other, recognize that they are on the same person, construct a secure
communications channel, and recognize the user to which they are attached. In
this paper we address a portion of this vision by offering a wearable system
that unobtrusively recognizes the person wearing it. Because it can recognize
the user, our system can properly label sensor data or personalize
interactions. <P> Our recognition method uses bioimpedance, a measurement of
how tissue responds when exposed to an electrical current. By collecting
bioimpedance samples using a small wearable device we designed, our system
can determine that (a)the wearer is indeed the expected person and (b)&nbsp;the
device is physically on the wearer's body. Our recognition method works with
98% balanced-accuracy under a cross-validation of a day's worth of
bioimpedance samples from a cohort of 8 volunteer subjects. We also
demonstrate that our system continues to recognize a subset of these subjects
even several months later. Finally, we measure the energy requirements of our
system as implemented on a Nexus&nbsp;S smart phone and custom-designed module for
the Shimmer sensing platform.</p>
