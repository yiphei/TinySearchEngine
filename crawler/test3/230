<p><b>Abstract:</b> MAC addresses can be easily spoofed in 802.11 wireless LANs. An
adversary can exploit this vulnerability to launch a large number of attacks.
For example, an attacker may masquerade as a legitimate access point to
disrupt network services or to advertise false services, tricking nearby
wireless stations. On the other hand, the received signal strength (RSS) is a
measurement that is hard to forge arbitrarily and it is highly correlated to
the transmitter's location. Assuming the attacker and the victim are
separated by a reasonable distance, RSS can be used to differentiate them to
detect MAC spoofing, as recently proposed by several researchers. <P> By
analyzing the RSS pattern of typical 802.11 transmitters in a 3-floor
building covered by 20 air monitors, we observed that the RSS readings
followed a mixture of multiple Gaussian distributions. We discovered that
this phenomenon was mainly due to  antenna diversity, a widely-adopted
technique to improve the stability and robustness of wireless connectivity.
This observation renders existing approaches ineffective because they assume
a single RSS source. We propose an approach based on Gaussian mixture models,
building RSS profiles for spoofing detection. Experiments on the same testbed
show that our method is robust against antenna diversity and significantly
outperforms existing approaches. At a 3 0.000000alse positive rate, we detect
73.4%, 89.6 0x0p+0nd 97.832536360f attacks using the three proposed algorithms,
based on local statistics of a single AM, combining local results from AMs,
and global multi-AM detection, respectively.</p>
