<p><b>Abstract:</b> Wireless network researchers are hungry for data about how real
users, applications, and devices use real networks under real network
conditions. CRAWDAD, the Community Resource for Archiving Wireless Data at
Dartmouth, is an NSF-funded project that is building a wireless network data
archive for the research community. We host wireless data, and provide tools
and documents to make it easy to collect and use wireless network data. We
hope that this resource will help researchers to identify and evaluate real
and interesting problems in mobile and pervasive computing. This report
outlines the CRAWDAD project and summarizes the third CRAWDAD workshop, held
at MobiCom 2007.</p>
