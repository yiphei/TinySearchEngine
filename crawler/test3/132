<p><b>Abstract:</b> High-performance distributed computing appears to be shifting
away from tightly-connected supercomputers to computational grids composed of
heterogeneous systems of networks, computers, storage devices, and various
other devices that collectively act as a single geographically distributed
virtual computer. One of the great challenges for this environment is
providing efficient parallel data access to remote distributed datasets. In
this paper, we discuss some of the issues associated with parallel I/O and
computatational grids and describe the design of a flexible parallel file
system that allows the application to control the behavior and functionality
of virtually all aspects of the file system.</p>
