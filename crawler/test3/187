<p><b>Abstract:</b> Most comparisons of wireless ad hoc routing algorithms involve
simulated or  indoor trial runs, or outdoor runs with only a small
number of nodes, potentially leading to an incorrect picture of algorithm
performance. In this paper, we report on an outdoor comparison of four
different routing algorithms, APRL, AODV, ODMRP, and STARA, running on top of
thirty-three 802.11-enabled laptops moving randomly through an athletic
field. This comparison provides insight into the behavior of ad hoc routing
algorithms at larger real-world scales than have been considered so far. In
addition, we compare the outdoor results with both indoor (``tabletop'') and
simulation results for the same algorithms, examining the differences between
the indoor results and the outdoor reality. Finally, we describe the software
infrastructure that allowed us to implement the ad hoc routing algorithms in
a comparable way, and use the  same codebase for indoor, outdoor, and
simulated trial runs.</p>
