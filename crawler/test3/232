<p><b>Abstract:</b> The edge of the Internet is increasingly wireless. Enterprises
large and small, homeowners, and even whole cities have deployed Wi-Fi
networks for their users, and many users never need to-- or never bother
to-- use the wired network. With the advent of high-throughput wireless
networks (such as 802.11n) some new construction, even of large enterprise
build- ings, may no longer be wired for Ethernet. To understand Internet
traffic, then, we need to understand the wireless edge. Measuring Wi-Fi
traffic, however, is challenging. It is insufficient to capture traffic in
the access points, or upstream of the access points, because the activity of
neighboring networks, ad hoc networks, and physical interference cannot be
seen at that level. To truly understand the MAC-layer behavior, we need to
capture frames from the air using Air Monitors (AMs) placed in the vicinity
of the network. Such a capture is always a sample of the network activity,
since it is physically impossible to capture a full trace: all frames from
all channels at all times in all places. We have built a monitoring
infrastructure that captures frames from the 802.11 network. This
infrastructure includes several "channel sampling" strategies that will
capture repre- sentative traffic from the network. Further, the monitoring
infrastructure needs to modify its behavior according to feedback received
from the downstream consumers of the captured traffic in case the analysis
needs traffic of a certain type. We call this technique "refocusing". The
"coordinated sampling" technique improves the efficiency of the monitoring by
utilizing the AMs intelligently. Finally, we deployed this measurement
infrastructure within our Computer Science building to study the performance
of the system with real network traffic.</p>
