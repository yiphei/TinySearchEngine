<p><b>Abstract:</b> As pervasive environments become more commonplace, the privacy of
users is placed at an increased risk. The numerous and diverse sensors in
these environments can record contextual information about users, leading to
users unwittingly leaving ``digital footprints.'' Users must therefore be
allowed to control how their digital footprints are reported to third
parties. While a significant amount of prior work has focused on location
privacy, location is only one specific type of footprint, and we expect most
users to be incapable of specifying fine-grained policies for a multitude of
footprints. In this paper we present a policy language based on the metaphor
of physical walls, and posit that users will find this to be an intuitive way
to control access to their digital footprints. For example, users understand
the physical privacy implications of conducting a meeting in a room enclosed
by physical walls. By allowing users to deploy ``virtual walls,'' they can
control the privacy of their digital footprints much in the same way they
control their privacy in the physical world. We present a policy framework
and model for virtual walls with three levels of transparency that correspond
to intuitive levels of privacy. We also describe the results of a user study
(N = 23) that indicates that our model is easy to understand and use.</p>
