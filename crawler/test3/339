<p><b>Abstract:</b> Mobile health technologies allow patients to collect their health
information outside the hospital and share this information with others. But
how can data consumers know whether to trust the sensor-collected and
human-entered data they receive? Data consumers might be able to verify the
accuracy and authenticity of the data if they have information about its
origin and about changes made to it, i.e., the provenance of the
data. We propose a provenance framework for mHealth devices, to collect and
share provenance metadata and help the data consumer verify whether certain
provenance properties are satisfied by the data they receive. This paper
describes the programming model for this framework, which describes the rules
to be implemented for providing provenance-collecting capabilities to an
mHealth application.</p>
