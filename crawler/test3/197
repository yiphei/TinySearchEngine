<b>A Combined Routing Method for Ad Hoc Wireless Networks</b>.
Technical Report
TR2009-641,
Dartmouth Computer Science,
February 
2009.
<p><b>Abstract:</b> Several simulation and real world studies show that certain ad
hoc routing protocols perform better than others under specific mobility and
traffic patterns. In order to exploit this phenomena, we propose a novel
approach to adapt a network to changing conditions; we introduce "a combined
routing method" that allows the network to seamlessly swap from one routing
protocol to another protocol dynamically, while routing continues
uninterrupted. By creating a thin new virtual layer, we enable each node in
the ad hoc wireless network notify each other about the protocol swap and we
do not make any changes to existing routing protocols. To ensure that routing
works efficiently after the protocol swap, we reuse information from the
previous protocol's routing table while initializing the data structures for
the new routing protocol. We study the feasibility of our technique and the
overheads incurred while swapping between AODV, ODMRP and APRL under
different network topologies and traffic patterns through detailed
simulations. Our results show that the swap latency is related to the nature
of the destination protocol and the topology of the network. We also find
that the control packet ratio of a routing protocol during and after a swap
is close to that of the protocol running before a swap, thus indicating that
our approach does not add excessive overhead.</p>
