<p><b>Abstract:</b> Mobile-agent systems must address three security issues:
protecting an individual machine, protecting a group of machines, and
protecting an agent. In this chapter, we discuss these three issues in the
context of D'Agents, a mobile-agent system whose agents can be written in
Tcl, Java and Scheme. (D'Agents was formerly known as Agent Tcl.) First we
discuss mechanisms existing in D'Agents for protecting an individual machine:
(1) cryptographic authentication of the agent's owner, (2) resource managers
that make policy decisions based on the owner's identity, and (3) secure
execution environments for each language that enforce the decisions of the
resource managers. Then we discuss our planned market-based approach for
protecting machine groups. Finally we consider several (partial) solutions
for protecting an agent from a malicious machine.</p>
