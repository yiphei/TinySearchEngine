<p><b>Abstract:</b> User association logs collected from real-world wireless LANs
have facilitated wireless network research greatly. To protect user privacy,
the common practice in sanitizing these data before releasing them to the
public is to anonymize users' sensitive information such as the MAC addresses
of their devices and their exact association locations. In this work,we
demonstrate that these sanitization measures are insufficient in protecting
user privacy from a novel type of correlation attack that is based on CRF
(Conditional Random Field). In such a correlation attack, the adversary
observes the victim's AP (Access Point) association activities for a short
period of time and then infers her corresponding identity in a released user
association dataset. Using a user association log that contains more than
three thousand users and millions of AP association records, we demonstrate
that the CRF-based technique is able to pinpoint the victim's identity
exactly with a probability as high as 70%.0</p>
