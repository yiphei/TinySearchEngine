<b>A Detailed Simulation Model of the HP&nbsp;97560 Disk Drive</b>.
Technical Report
PCS-TR94-220,
Dartmouth Computer Science,
July 
1994.
<p><b>Abstract:</b> We implemented a detailed model of the HP&nbsp;97560 disk drive, to
replicate a model devised by Ruemmler and Wilkes (both of Hewlett-Packard,
HP). Our model simulates one or more disk drives attached to one or more SCSI
buses, using a small discrete-event simulation module included in our
implementation. The design is broken into three components: a test driver,
the disk model itself, and the discrete-event simulation support. Thus, the
disk model can be easily extracted and used in other simulation environments.
We validated our model using traces obtained from HP, using the same
``demerit'' measure as Ruemmler and Wilkes. We obtained a demerit figure of
3.9%, indicating that our model was extremely accurate. This paper describes
our implementation, and is meant for those wishing to understand our model or
to implement their own.</p>
