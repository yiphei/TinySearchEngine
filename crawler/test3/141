<b>Economic Markets as a Means of Open Mobile-Agent Systems</b>.

<i>Proceedings of the Workshop ``Mobile Agents in the Context of
Competition and Cooperation (MAC3)'' at Autonomous Agents&nbsp;'99</i>,

<p><b>Abstract:</b> Mobile-agent systems have gained popularity in use because they
ease the application design process by giving software engineers greater
flexibility. Although the value of any network is dependent on both the
number of users and the number of sites participating in the network, there
is little motivation for systems to donate resources to arbitrary agents. We
propose to remedy the problem by imposing an economic market on mobile-agent
systems where agents purchase resources from host sites and sell services to
users and other agents. Host sites accumulate revenues, which are distributed
to users to be used to launch more agents. We argue for the use of markets to
regulate mobile-agent systems and discuss open issues in implementing
market-based mobile-agent systems.</p>
