<p><b>Abstract:</b> Context-aware pervasive-computing applications require continuous
monitoring of their physical and computational environment to make
appropriate adaptation decisions in time. The data streams produced by
sensors, however, may overflow the queues on the dissemination path.
Traditional flow-control and congestion-control policies either drop data or
force the sender to pause. When the data sender is sensing the physical
environment, however, a pause is equivalent to dropping data. Instead of
arbitrarily dropping data that may contain important events, we present a
policy-driven data dissemination service named PACK, based on an
overlay-based infrastructure for efficient multicast delivery. PACK enforces
application-specified policies that define how to discard or summarize data
flows wherever queues overflow on the data path, notably at the mobile hosts
where applications often reside. A key contribution of our approach is to
uniformly apply the data-stream ``packing'' abstraction to queue overflow
caused by network congestion, slow receivers, and temporary disconnection. We
present experimental results and a detailed application study of the PACK
service.</p>
