<p><b>Abstract:</b> Use of the Internet has exploded in recent years with the
appearance of the World-Wide Web. In this paper, we show how current
technological trends may lead to a system based substantially on mobile code,
and in many cases, mobile agents. We discuss several technical and
non-technical hurdles along the path to that eventuality. It seems likely
that, within a few years, nearly all major Internet sites will be capable of
hosting and willing to host some form of mobile code or mobile agents.</p>
