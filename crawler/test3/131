<b>An Implementation of the Vesta Parallel File System API on the
Galley Parallel File System</b>.
Technical Report

<p><b>Abstract:</b> To demonstrate the flexibility of the Galley parallel file system
and to analyze the efficiency and flexibility of the Vesta parallel file
system interface, we implemented Vesta's application-programming interface on
top of Galley. We implemented the Vesta interface using Galley's file-access
methods, whose design arose from extensive testing and characterization of
the I/O requirements of scientific applications for high-performance
multiprocessors. We used a parallel CPU, parallel I/O, out-of-core
matrix-multiplication application to test the Vesta interface in both its
ability to specify data access patterns and in its run-time efficiency. In
spite of its powerful ability to specify the distribution of regular,
non-overlapping data access patterns across disks, we found that the Vesta
interface has some significant limitations. We discuss these limitations in
detail in the paper, along with the performance results.</p>
