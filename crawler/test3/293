<p><b>Abstract:</b> We consider a distributed system that disseminates high-volume
event streams to many simultaneous monitoring applications over a
low-bandwidth network. For bandwidth efficiency, we propose a
\textitgroup-aware stream filtering approach, used together with
multicasting, that exploits two overlooked, yet important, properties of
monitoring applications: 1)&nbsp;many of them can tolerate some degree of
``slack'' in their data quality requirements, and 2)&nbsp;there may exist multiple
subsets of the source data satisfying the quality needs of an application. We
can thus choose the ``best alternative'' subset for each application to
maximize the data overlap within the group to best benefit from multicasting.
Here we provide a general framework for the group-aware stream filtering
problem, which we prove is NP-hard. We introduce a suite of heuristics-based
algorithms that ensure data quality (specifically, granularity and
timeliness) while preserving bandwidth. Our evaluation shows that group-aware
stream filtering is effective in trading CPU time for bandwidth savings,
compared with self-interested filtering.</p>
