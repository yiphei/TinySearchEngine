<p><b>Abstract:</b> Understanding usage patterns in wireless local-area networks
(WLANs) is critical for those who develop, deploy, and manage WLAN
technology, as well as those who develop systems and application software for
wireless networks. This paper presents results from the largest and most
comprehensive trace of network activity in a large, production wireless LAN.
For eleven weeks we traced the activity of nearly two thousand users drawn
from a general campus population, using a campus-wide network of 476 access
points spread over 161 buildings at Dartmouth College. Our study expands on
those done by Tang and Baker, with a significantly larger and broader
population. <P> We found that residential traffic dominated all other
traffic, particularly in residences populated by newer students; students are
increasingly choosing a wireless laptop as their primary computer. Although
web protocols were the single largest component of traffic volume, network
backup and file sharing contributed an unexpectedly large amount to the
traffic. Although there was some roaming within a network session, we were
surprised by the number of situations in which cards roamed excessively,
unable to settle on one access point. Cross-subnet roams were an especial
problem, because they broke IP connections, indicating the need for solutions
that avoid or accommodate such roams.</p>
