<b>Application-Controlled Loss-Tolerant Data Dissemination</b>.
Technical Report

<p><b>Abstract:</b> Reactive or proactive mobile applications require continuous
monitoring of their physical and computational environment to make
appropriate decisions in time. These applications need to monitor data
streams produced by sensors and react to changes. When mobile sensors and
applications are connected by low-bandwidth wireless networks, sensor data
rates may overwhelm the capacity of network links or of the applications. In
traditional networks and distributed systems, flow-control and
congestion-control policies either drop data or force the sender to pause.
When the data sender is sensing the physical environment, however, a pause is
equivalent to dropping data. Arbitrary data drops are not necessarily
acceptable to the reactive mobile applications receiving sensor data. Data
distribution systems must support application-specific policies that
selectively drop data objects when network or application buffers overflow.
<P> In this paper we present a data-dissemination service, PACK, which
allows applications to specify customized data-reduction policies. These
policies define how to discard or summarize data flows wherever buffers
overflow on the dissemination path, notably at the mobile hosts where
applications often reside. The PACK service provides an overlay
infrastructure to support mobile data sources and sinks, using
application-specific data-reduction policies where necessary along the data
path. We uniformly apply the data-stream ``packing'' abstraction to buffer
overflow caused by network congestion, slow receivers, and the temporary
disconnections caused by end-host mobility. We demonstrate the effectiveness
of our approach with an application example and experimental measurements.</p>
