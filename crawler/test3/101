<p><b>Abstract:</b> Many parallel scientific applications need high-performance I/O.
Unfortunately, end-to-end parallel-I/O performance has not been able to keep
up with substantial improvements in parallel-I/O hardware because of poor
parallel file-system software. Many radical changes, both at the interface
level and the implementation level, have recently been proposed. One such
proposed interface is  collective I/O, which allows parallel jobs to
request transfer of large contiguous objects in a single request, thereby
preserving useful semantic information that would otherwise be lost if the
transfer were expressed as per-processor non-contiguous requests. Kotz has
proposed  disk-directed I/O as an efficient implementation technique for
collective-I/O operations, where the compute processors make a single
collective data-transfer request, and the I/O processors thereafter take full
control of the actual data transfer, exploiting their detailed knowledge of
the disk-layout to attain substantially improved performance. <P> Recent
parallel file-system usage studies show that writes to write-only files are a
dominant part of the workload. Therefore, optimizing writes could have a
significant impact on overall performance. In this paper, we propose ENWRICH,
a compute-processor write-caching scheme for write-only files in parallel
file systems. ENWRICH combines low-overhead write caching at the compute
processors with high performance disk-directed I/O at the I/O processors to
achieve both low latency and high bandwidth. This combination facilitates the
use of the powerful disk-directed I/O technique independent of any particular
choice of interface. By collecting writes over many files and applications,
ENWRICH lets the I/O processors optimize disk I/O over a large pool of
requests. We evaluate our design via simulated implementation and show that
ENWRICH achieves high performance for various configurations and workloads.</p>
