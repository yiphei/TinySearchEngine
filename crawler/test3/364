Senior Honors Thesis.
<p><b>Abstract:</b> The Amulet is a health monitor, similar in size and shape to a
smartwatch but specifically designed to have a longer battery life and handle
data securely. It is equipped with a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) radio in
order to receive data from BLE-enabled sensors and transmit data to
smartphones, but the full implementation of BLE communication on the Amulet
is still a work in progress. This thesis describes architectural changes that
improve the Amulet's ability to receive data from a variety of BLE-enabled
sensors and make it easier for developers to integrate new BLE-enabled
sensors with the Amulet by introducing support for connecting to multiple
sensors at the same time, rewriting the radio code to be more generic, and
exposing BLE functionality to the AmuletOS. We discuss the relevant parts of
the AmuletOS and the BLE protocol as background, describe the current
structure of BLE communications on the Amulet, and document the proposed
changes to create a system for easily integrating new BLE-enabled sensors and
handling connections to multiple sensors simultaneously.</p>
