<b>Workshop report -- CRAWDAD Workshop 2006</b>.
<i>ACM SIGMOBILE Mobile Computing and Communication Review</i>,
11(1):67-69,
January 
2007.
<p><b>Abstract:</b> Wireless network researchers are seriously starved for data about
how real users, applications, and devices use real networks under real
network conditions. CRAWDAD, the Community Resource for Archiving Wireless
Data at Dartmouth, is an NSF-funded project that is building a wireless
network data archive for the research community. We host wireless data, and
provide tools and documents to make it easy to collect and use wireless
network data. We hope that this resource will help researchers to identify
and evaluate real and interesting problems in mobile and pervasive computing.
This report outlines the CRAWDAD project and summarizes the second CRAWDAD
workshop, held at MobiCom 2006.</p>
