<p><b>Abstract:</b> How can data consumers know whether to trust the sensor-collected
and human-entered data they receive from mHealth devices? What confidence do
they have that it is accurate and authentic? Data recipients might be able to
verify the accuracy and authenticity of the data if they have information
about its origin and about changes made to it, i.e., the provenance of the
data.We define provenance in mHealth as contextual information that can
attest to the authenticity and accuracy of the data and can help the
recipient in interpreting the data. To realize this vision, we propose a
provenance framework for mHealth. The primary function of the framework is to
collect and share provenance metadata and help the data consumer verify
whether certain provenance properties are satisfied by the data they
receive.</p>
