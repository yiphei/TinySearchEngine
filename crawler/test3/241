<p><b>Abstract:</b> Determining whether a client station should trust an access point
is a known problem in wireless security. Traditional approaches to solving
this problem resort to cryptography. But cryptographic exchange protocols are
complex and therefore induce potential vulnerabilities in themselves. We show
that measurement of clock skews of access points in an 802.11 network can be
useful in this regard, since it provides fingerprints of the devices. Such
fingerprints can be used to establish the first point of trust for client
stations wishing to connect to an access point. Fingerprinting can also be
used in the detection of fake access points. <P> We demonstrate deficiencies
of previously studied methods that measure clock skews in 802.11 networks by
means of an attack that spoofs clock skews. We then provide means to overcome
those deficiencies, thereby improving the reliability of fingerprinting.
Finally, we show how to perform the clock-skew arithmetic that enables
network providers to publish clock skews of their access points for use by
clients.</p>
