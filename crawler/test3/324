<p><b>Abstract:</b> As healthcare in many countries faces an aging population and
rising costs, mobile sensing technologies promise a new opportunity. Using
mobile health (mHealth) sensing, which uses medical sensors to collect data
about the patients, and mobile phones to act as a gateway between sensors and
electronic health record systems, caregivers can continuously monitor the
patients and deliver better care. Although some work on mHealth sensing has
addressed security, achieving strong security and privacy for low-power
sensors remains a challenge. <P> We make three contributions. First, we
propose Adapt-lite, a set of two techniques that can be applied to existing
wireless protocols to make them energy efficient without compromising their
security or privacy properties. The techniques are: adaptive security, which
dynamically modifies packet overhead; and MAC striping, which makes forgery
difficult even for small-sized MACs. Second, we apply these techniques to an
existing wireless protocol, and demonstrate a prototype on a Chronos wrist
device. Third, we provide security, privacy, and energy analysis of our
techniques.</p>
