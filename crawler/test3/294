<p><b>Abstract:</b> In this paper we are concerned with disseminating high-volume
data streams to many simultaneous applications over a low-bandwidth wireless
mesh network. For bandwidth efficiency, we propose a \textitgroup-aware
stream filtering approach, used in conjunction with multicasting, that
exploits two overlooked, yet important, properties of these applications:
1)&nbsp;many applications can tolerate some degree of ``slack'' in their data
quality requirements, and 2)&nbsp;there may exist multiple subsets of the source
data satisfying the quality needs of an application. We can thus choose the
``best alternative'' subset for each application to maximize the data overlap
within the group to best benefit from multicasting. An evaluation of our
prototype implementation shows that group-aware data filtering can save
bandwidth with low CPU overhead. We also analyze the key factors that affect
its performance, based on testing with heterogeneous filtering requirements.</p>
