<p><b>Abstract:</b> The advent of affordable devices with sensors and communication
capabilities has led to the proliferation of computing paradigms, such as the
Internet of Things (IoT), mobile devices, and wearable technologies. For the
sake of simplicity, we use the umbrella term "small devices" for these
technologies. At the same time, in the past decade, the increasing
availability of large datasets has shifted scientists' attention toward data
science, and defined new trends in computation. Even some scientists call it
an evolutionary shift that has changed the pace of scientific progress, i.e.,
the "fourth paradigm".</p>
