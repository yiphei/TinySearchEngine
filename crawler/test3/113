<p><b>Abstract:</b> High-performance parallel file systems are needed to satisfy
tremendous I/O requirements of parallel scientific applications. The design
of such high-performance parallel file systems depends on a comprehensive
understanding of the expected workload, but so far there have been very few
usage studies of multiprocessor file systems. This paper is part of the
CHARISMA project, which intends to fill this void by measuring real
file-system workloads on various production parallel machines. In particular,
here we present results from the CM-5 at the National Center for
Supercomputing Applications. Our results are unique because we collect
information about nearly every individual I/O request from the mix of jobs
running on the machine. Analysis of the traces leads to various
recommendations for parallel file-system design.</p>
