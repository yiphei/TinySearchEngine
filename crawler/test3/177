<b>Future Directions for Mobile-Agent Research</b>.
Technical Report
TR2002-415,
Dartmouth Computer Science,
January 
2002.
Based on a conversation with Jeff Bradshaw, Colin Harrison, Guenter
Karjoth, Amy Murphy, Gian Pietro Picco, M. Ranganathan, Niranjan Suri, and
Christian Tschudin.
<p><b>Abstract:</b> During a discussion in September 2000 the authors examined the
future of research on mobile agents and mobile code. (A mobile agent is a
running program that can move from host to host in network at times and to
places of its own choosing.) In this paper we summarize and reflect on that
discussion. It became clear that the field should shift its emphasis toward
mobile code, in all its forms, rather than to continue its narrow focus on
mobile agents. Furthermore, we encourage the development of modular
components, so that application designers may take advantage of code mobility
without needing to rewrite their application to fit in a monolithic
mobile-agent system. There are many potential applications that may
productively use mobile code, but there is no ``killer application'' for
mobile agents. Finally, we note that although security is an important and
challenging problem, there are many applications and environments with
security requirements well within the capability of existing mobile-code and
mobile-agent frameworks.</p>
