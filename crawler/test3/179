<p><b>Abstract:</b> Mobile agents are an increasingly popular paradigm and in recent
years there has been a proliferation of mobile-agent systems. These systems
are, however, largely incompatible with each other. In particular, agents
cannot migrate to a host that runs a different mobile-agent system. Prior
approaches to interoperability have tried to force agents to use a common API
and so far none have succeeded. This goal led to our efforts to develop
mechanisms that support dynamic runtime interoperability of mobile-agent
systems. This paper describes the  Grid Mobile-Agent System, which
allows agents to migrate to different mobile-agent systems.</p>
