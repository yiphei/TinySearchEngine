<b>Performance Analysis of Mobile Agents for Filtering Data Streams on
Wireless Networks</b>.
Technical Report
TR2000-377,
Dartmouth Computer Science,
October 
2000.
<p><b>Abstract:</b> Wireless networks are an ideal environment for mobile agents,
since their mobility allows them to move across an unreliable link to reside
on a wired host, next to or closer to the resources that they need to use.
Furthermore, client-specific data transformations can be moved across the
wireless link and run on a wired gateway server, reducing bandwidth demands.
In this paper we examine the tradeoffs faced when deciding whether to use
mobile agents in a data-filtering application where numerous wireless clients
filter information from a large data stream arriving across the wired
network. We develop an analytical model and use parameters from filtering
experiments conducted during a U.S. Navy Fleet Battle Experiment (FBE) to
explore the model's implications.</p>
