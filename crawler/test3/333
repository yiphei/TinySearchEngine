<b>Exposing Privacy Concerns in mHealth Data Sharing</b>.

<p><b>Abstract:</b> Mobile health (mHealth) has become important in the field of
healthcare information technology, as patients begin to use mobile devices to
record their daily activities and vital signs. These devices can record
personal health information even outside the hospital setting, while the
patients are at home or at their workplace. However, the devices might record
sensitive information that might not be relevant for medical purposes and in
some cases may be misused. Patients need expressive privacy controls so that
they can trade potential health benefits of the technology with the privacy
risks. To provide such privacy controls, it is important to understand what
patients feel are the benefits and risks associated with the technology and
what controls they want over the information. <P> We conducted focus groups
to understand the privacy concerns that patients have when they use mHealth
devices. We conducted a user study to understand how willing patients are to
share their personal health information that was collected using an mHealth
device. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first study that explores
users' privacy concerns by giving them the opportunity to actually share the
information collected about them using mHealth devices. We found that
patients tend to share more information with third parties than the public
and prefer to keep certain information from their family and friends.
Finally, based on these discoveries, we propose some guidelines to developing
defaults for sharing settings in mHealth systems.</p>
