<b>Localized Bridging Centrality for Distributed Network Analysis</b>.

<p><b>Abstract:</b> Centrality is a concept often used in social network analysis to
study different properties of networks that are modeled as graphs. We present
a new centrality metric called Localized Bridging Centrality (LBC). LBC is
based on the Bridging Centrality (BC) metric that Hwang et al. recently
introduced. Bridging nodes are nodes that are located in between highly
connected regions. LBC is capable of identifying bridging nodes with an
accuracy comparable to that of the BC metric for most networks. As the name
suggests, we use only local information from surrounding nodes to compute the
LBC metric, while, global knowledge is required to calculate the BC metric.
The main difference between LBC and BC is that LBC uses the egocentric
definition of betweenness centrality to identify bridging nodes, while BC
uses the sociocentric definition of betweenness centrality. Thus, our LBC
metric is suitable for distributed computation and has the benefit of being
an order of magnitude faster to calculate in computational complexity. We
compare the results produced by BC and LBC in three examples. We applied our
LBC metric for network analysis of a real wireless mesh network. Our results
indicate that the LBC metric is as powerful as the BC metric at identifying
bridging nodes that have a higher flow of information through them (assuming
a uniform distribution of network flows) and are important for the robustness
of the network.</p>
