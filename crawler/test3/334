<p><b>Abstract:</b> mHealth devices offer many potential benefits to patients, health
providers and others involved in the patients' healthcare. If patients are
not in control of the collection and sharing of their personal health
information, they will have privacy concerns even while enjoying the benefits
of the devices. We investigated patients' willingness to share their personal
health information, collected using mHealth devices, with their family,
friends, third parties and the public. Our findings are based on a user study
conducted with 41 participants. The best way to understand people's privacy
concerns is to give them the opportunity to use the device and actually share
the information, and to the best of our knowledge, ours is the first study
that does so. We discovered that patients want to share, selectively, their
health information with people other than their doctors. We also show that
privacy concerns are not static; patients may change their sharing decisions
over time. Based on our findings, we suggest that privacy controls for
mHealth systems should be flexible to allow patients to choose different
settings for different recipients, and to change their sharing settings at
any time.</p>
