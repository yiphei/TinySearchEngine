<p><b>Abstract:</b> Many scientific applications that run on today's multiprocessors
are bottlenecked by their file I/O needs. Even if the multiprocessor is
configured with sufficient I/O hardware, the file-system software often fails
to provide the available bandwidth to the application. Although libraries and
improved file-system interfaces can make a significant improvement, we
believe that fundamental changes are needed in the file-server software. We
propose a new technique,  disk-directed I/O, that flips the usual
relationship between server and client to allow the disks (actually, disk
servers) to determine the flow of data for maximum performance. Our
simulations show that tremendous performance gains are possible. Indeed,
disk-directed I/O provided consistent high performance that was largely
independent of data distribution, and close to the maximum disk bandwidth.</p>
