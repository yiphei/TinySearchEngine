<p><b>Abstract:</b> Wireless networks are an ideal environment for mobile agents,
because their mobility allows them to move across an unreliable link to
reside on a wired host, next to or closer to the resources they need to use.
Furthermore, client-specific data transformations can be moved across the
wireless link, and run on a wired gateway server, with the goal of reducing
bandwidth demands. In this paper we examine the tradeoffs faced when deciding
whether to use mobile agents to support a data-filtering application, in
which numerous wireless clients filter information from a large data stream
arriving across the wired network. We develop an analytical model and use
parameters from our own experiments to explore the model's implications.</p>
