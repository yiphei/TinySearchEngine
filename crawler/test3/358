<p><b>Abstract:</b> Mobile devices allow people to collect and share health and
health-related information with recipients such as health providers, family
and friends, employers and insurance companies, to obtain health, emotional
or financial benefits. People may consider certain health information
sensitive and prefer to disclose only what is necessary. In this
dissertation, we present our findings about factors that affect peopleâ€™s
sharing behavior, describe scenarios in which people may wish to collect and
share their personal health-related information with others, but may be
hesitant to disclose the information if necessary controls are not available
to protect their privacy, and propose frameworks to provide the desired
privacy controls. We introduce the concept of close encounters that allow
users to share data with other people who may have been in spatio-temporal
proximity. We developed two smartphone-based systems that leverage stationary
sensors and beacons to determine whether users are in spatio-temporal
proximity. The first system, ENACT, allows patients diagnosed with a
contagious airborne disease to alert others retrospectively about their
possible exposure to airborne virus. The second system, SPICE, allows users
to collect sensor information, retrospectively, from others with whom they
shared a close encounter. We present design and implementation of the two
systems, analyse their security and privacy guarantees, and evaluate the
systems on various performance metrics. Finally, we evaluate how Bluetooth
beacons and Wi-Fi access points can be used in support of these systems for
close encounters, and present our experiences and findings from a deployment
study on Dartmouth campus.</p>
