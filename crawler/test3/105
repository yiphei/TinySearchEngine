</H2>

<hr>
<P> STARFISH is a simulator for experimenting with concepts in
parallel file systems.  It is based on Eric Brewer's <EM> Proteus</EM>
simulator from MIT, and runs only on (MIPS-based) DECstations.  I have
used this simulator in experiments for several research <A
HREF="../papers/"> papers</A> about <EM> disk-directed I/O</EM>,
and am actively extending it and using it for further
experiments. </P>

<H2>Warning: </H2> 
 <P> <EM> I am providing the code as-is, with little cleanup or added
documentation.  Some of the code is out-of-date and may have bugs.
Other parts are incomplete.  Many of the analysis scripts are fragile.
The code is constantly evolving, and new public releases may be rare.
But many people have asked me for it, so here it is.</EM></P>

See other warnings in the src/README file.

<H2>Usage rules:</H2>
 <P> You're welcome to look at the code and even try to run it, but I
really don't have time to help you out much.  If you publish any
results based on this simulator, please cite me and provide the URL
for this page.</P>

<H2>Copying rules: </H2>
 <P> This package may be freely copied as long as it is kept intact
with my name on it.  Please send me a note if you have a copy of this
code, so I can keep track of how many copies there are, send you email
about new versions, and so forth.  Please ask me before you distribute
any modified version.</P>

<H2>Other software you need:</H2>

<P> This package is based on Proteus version 3.01 by <A
HREF="http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~brewer/">Eric Brewer</A> I have
fixed several bugs in the 'stats' program; I supply a MIPS executable
of the fixed program, and the patches needed to make my version from
the original stats sources.</P>

<H2> OSDI note: </H2> 
  <P> The code included here has evolved since the experiments in some
of those papers were run; in particular, the <A
HREF="../papers/#kotz:diskdir"> OSDI results</A> are based on an
earlier, buggier version of iopfs-cache.  See the <A
HREF="../papers/#kotz:diskdir-tr"> TR version</A> of that paper
for correct results. </P>

<H2> The name:</H2>
 <P>The name STARFISH is an acronym, but it fits with the maritime
theme of the Proteus simulator on which it is based (Proteus was a
Greek god of the sea), and of the <A HREF="/research/fleet/">FLEET
lab</A>, where we hope to implement some of the ideas which were
developed using the STARFISH simulator.</P>
